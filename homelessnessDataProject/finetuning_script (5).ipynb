Purpose  Jewish Family Service of San Diego (JFS) shall provide nutritionally sound meals to individuals   sixty (60) years of age and older living throughout the City of Poway. The meals shall be    provided via No-Touch Drive-Thru Food Distributions. There is no charge to the senior for these    services. The eligible population is individuals sixty (60) years of age or older with emphasis on    those in greatest economic and social need. 2. Goal   Assist individuals sixty (60) years of age and older who are vulnerable to COVID-19 and need to    maintain their nutritional needs while sheltering-in-place. 3. Deliverables   Continue providing meals to seniors via No-Touch Drive-thru Food Distributions.JFS will distribute a maximum of 25,912 meals at $9.50 a meal to Poway seniors from Janua y 1,    2021 through March 30, 2022.Attachment 2December 21, 2020 Thank you again for choosing to partner with Jewish Family Service of San Diego (JFS) to serve Poways food-insecure seniors. Since the onset of our      CDBG funded. program on October 7, 2020, JFS has served an average of 40      to 45 seniors each week, With your support, JFS is on track to provide 9,600      meals to this vulnerable population by December 31, 2020, JFS is requesting the Cit, of Poway to continue this parmership with a contribution of $246,166. Your support will allow JES to provide 25,912      nutritious meals at $9.50 per meal to older adults who are sheltering in placeduring the COVID-19 pandemic. To supplement current home-delivered meal      programs and ensure participant safety, meals will be provided through No- Touch Drive-Thru Food Distributions in Poway from January. 1, 2021 through    March 30, 2022. Meals will be provided at no cost to recipients. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more challenging for seniors to  obtain access to food and nutritional services. Older adults who once received hot lunches at IFS's congregate meal sites now must remain at  home but still need nutritious meals each day, Seniors who were able to source their own meals or have them provided by loved ones are no longer able to do so or are fearful to, With your support, these seniors are now able to turn to JFS's drive-thru distributions for their nutritional needs.Because this population is most susceptible to COVID-19, we anticipate they will continue sheltering in place for an extended period of time, To meet the continued demand, IFS needs significant additional funding to support the sustained need for nutrition support for vulnerable older adults. Support from the City of Poway will go directly to help Poways low-income seniors stay nourished as they shelter in place. Thank you for your consideration.Jewish Family Service of San Diego - First Amendment.txtDisplaying Jewish Family Service of San Diego - First Amendment.txt.\"\n",
