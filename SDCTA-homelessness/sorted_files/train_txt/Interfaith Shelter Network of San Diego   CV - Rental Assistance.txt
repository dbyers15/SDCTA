grantee .) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used for rep011ing purposes, for purposes
of applying the requirement under § 570.5 04( 6 )(2)( i i i ), and in determining limitations on planning and adm inistration and
public services activities to be paid for with CDBG funds.
( 4) Program income does not include:
(i) Any income received in a single program year by the recipient and all its subrecipients if the total amount of such
income does not exceed $25 ,000; and
(ii) Amounts generated by activities that are financed by a loan guaranteed under section 1 08 of the Act and meet one or
more of the public benefit criteria specified at § 5 70 .209(b ) ( 2 )( v ) or are carried out in conjunction with a grant under section
I 08(q) in an area determined by HUD to meet the eligibil ity requirements for designation as an Urban Empowerment Zone
pursuant to 24 C F R part 5 97, subpart B. Such exclusion shall not apply if CDBG funds are used to repay the guaranteed
loan. When such a guaranteed loan is partially repaid with CDBG funds, the amount generated shall be prorated to reflect
the percentage of CDBG funds used. Amounts generated by activities financed with loans guaranteed under section 1 0 8
which are not defined as program income shall b e treated as miscellaneous revenue and shall not b e subject to any o f the
requirements of this part, except that the use of such funds shall be limited to activities that are located in a revitalization

strategy area and implement a HUD approved area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 9 1 .2 1 5 ( e ) of this title. However,
such treatment shall not affect the right of the Secretary to require the section 1 08 borrower to pledge such amounts
as security for the guaranteed loan . The determination whether such amounts shall constitute program income shall be
governed by the provisions of the contract required at § 5 70.705(b )( I ).
( 5 ) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities caiTied
out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance (the costs of fundraising are generally unallowable under the applicable
0MB circulars referenced in 24 CFR 84.27), funds collected through special assessments used to recover the non-CDBG
po1tion of a public improvement, and proceeds from the disposition of real prope1ty acquired or improved with CDBG
funds when the disposition occurs after the applicable time period specified in § 5 70.503(b ) ( 8 ) for subrecipient-controlled
prope1ty, or i n § 5 70.505 for recipient-control led property.
(b) Revolving fund means a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established
for the purpose of carrying out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use in carrying out the same
activities. Each revolving loan fund's cash balance must b e held in an interest-bearing account, and any interest paid on CDBG
funds held in this account shall be considered interest earned on grant advances and must be remitted to HUD for transmittal
to the U.S. Treasury no less frequently than annually. (Interest paid by borrowers on eligible loans made from the revolving
loan fund shall be program income and treated accordingly.)
(c) Subrecipient m eans a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization, or a for-profit entity authorized under §
5 70.20 I ( o ), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another subrecipient to undertake activities eligible for such assistance
under subpart C of this part. The term excludes an entity receiving CDBG funds from the recipient u nder the authority of §
5 70.204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a subrecipient. The term includes a public agency designated by a unit of
general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of this pa1t, but does not include contractors providing
supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D .

(2) I f the recipient chooses to retain program income, that program income shall be disposed of as follows:
( i ) Program income in the form of repayments to, or interest earned on, a revolving fund as defined in § 5 70 . S00( b ) shall
be substantially disbursed from the fund before additional cash withdrawals are made from the U.S. Treasury for the same

section, income received after closeout shall not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that, if at the time of
closeout the recipient has another ongoing CDBG grant received directly from HUD, funds received after closeout shall
be treated as program income of the ongoing grant program.
( 5 ) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income received
after closeout from the disposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall not be governed
by the provisions of this part, except that such income shall be used for activities that meet one of the national objectives
in § 5 70 .90 I and the eligibil ity requirements described in section 1 0 5 of the Act.

treat as applicable to grants made to states under section l 06(d) of the Act for purposes of the determination required to be
made by the Secretary pursuant to section I 04( e )(2 ) of the Act, see § 5 70 .48 7.

( i ) For purposes of paragrap h (b) of this section, the term "displaced person" means any person (family, ind ividual, business,
nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real propet1y, or moves his or her personal property from real property,
permanently and i nvoluntarily, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acqu i sition for an activity assisted under
this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a pemrnnent move from real prope11y that is made:
(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if applicable) to move permanently from the property, if the
move occurs after the initial official submission to HUD (or the State, as applicable) for grant, loan, or loan guarantee
funds under this pa11 that are later provided or granted.
(B) After notice by the prope11y owner to move permanently from the prope11y, if the move occurs after the date of
the submission of a request for financial assistance by the property owner (or person in control of the site) that is
later approved for the requested activity.

§ 570.606 Displacement, relocati on, a cq u isiti o n , and . . . , 24 C . F.R. § 570.606
(C) Before the date described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B ) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee (or State,
as app l i cable) detem1 ines that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for
the requested activity.
(D) After the "initiation of negotiations" if the person is the tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit and any one of the
following three situations occurs:
( 1 ) The tenant has not been provided with a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable decent, safe,
and sanitary dwell i ng in the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a monthly
rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average utility costs before the
initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income; or
(2) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of
moving to and from the temporary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions of the temporary
relocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the building/complex; or
( 3 ) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the building/complex, but is not offered reimbursement for
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move.
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the tem1 "displaced person-" does not include:
(A) A p erson who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material terms of the lease
or occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this basis, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable)
must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation
assistance under this section;
(B) A person who moves into the property after the date of the notice described in paragraph ( b )(2)(i)(A) or (B) of
this section, but who received a written notice of the expected displacement before occupancy.
(C) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)( 2 ) .
( D ) A person who the grantee ( o r State, a s applicable) dete1mines is not displaced a s a direct result o f the acquisition,
rehabi l itation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that
determination.
(iii) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) m ay, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a person
is a displaced person under this section.
(3 ) Initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the type of replacement housing assistance to be provided under
paragraph (b) of this section, if the displacement is the d i rect result of privately undertaken rehabi l itation, demolition,

or acquisition of real property, the term "in itiation of negotiations" means the execution of the grant or loan agreement
between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as appl icable) and the person owning or control ling the real property.
(c) Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan. The grantee shall comply with the requirements of 24 CFR
part 42, subpart B.
(d) Optional relocation ass i stance. Under section 1 05 (a)( l l ) of the Act, the grantee may provide (or the State may permit the
state recipient to provide, as app licable) relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by activities
that are not subject to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide (or the State may also permit the
state recipient to provide, as app licable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this
section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraph s . Unless such assistance is provided under State or local law, the
grantee (or state recipient, as appl icable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a written determination that the
assistance is appropriate (see, e.g., 24 CFR 5 70.20 I (i ), as applicable). The grantee (or state recipient, as appl icable) must adopt
a written pol icy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable)
has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.
( e) Acquisition of real prope1ty. The acquisition of real prope1iy for an assisted activity is subj ect to 49 CFR part 24, s ubpmi B .
(f) Appeals. If a person disagrees with the determination o f the grantee (or the state recipient, a s applicable) concerning the
person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment under this section, the person may file a written appeal of that
determination with the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable). The appeal procedures to be fo llowed are described in 49 CFR
24. 1 0 . I n addition, a low- o r moderate-income household that has been displaced from a dwelling may fi le a written request for
review of the grantee's decision to the HUD Field Office. For purposes of the State CDBG program, a low- or moderate-income
household may file a written request for review of the state recipient's decision with the State.
(g) Responsibility of grantee or State.
( 1 ) The grantee (or State, if applicable) is responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this section,
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with the provisions of this section. For
purposes of the State CDBG program, the State shall require state recipients to certify that they will comply with the
requirements of this section.
(2) The cost of assistance required under this section may be paid from local public funds, funds provided under this pa1i,
or funds avai lable from other sources.
( 3 ) The grantee (or State and state recipient, as appl icable) must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this section.

(d) Exceptions. Upon the written request of the recipient, H UD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of

§ 570 . 6 1 1 Conflict of interest., 24 C . F.R. § 570.6 1 1
( 1 ) Threshold requirements. H U D will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following
documentation:
(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been pub l ic disclosure of the
conflict and a description of how the public d isclosure was made; and
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or
local law.
(2) Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has
satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)( l ) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an exception will
serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's program or project,
taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as appl icable:
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expe1iise to the program or
project that would otherwise not be available;
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the
beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or
benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;
(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process
with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b)
of this section;
(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public
i nterest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and
(vii) Any other relevant considerations.

Currentness
(a) General. Executive Order 1 23 72, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and the Department's implementing
regulations at 24 CFR pat1 52, allow each State to establish its own process for review and comment on proposed Federal
financial assistance programs.
(b) Applicability. Executive Order 1 2372 applies to the CDBG Entitlement program and the UDAG program. The Executive
Order applies to all activities proposed to be assisted under UDAG, but it applies to the Entitlement program only where a
grantee proposes to use funds for the planning or construction (reconstruction or installation) of water or sewer facilities. Such
facilities include storm sewers as well as all sanitary sewers, but do not include water and sewer lines connecting a structure
to the l ines in the public right-of-way or easement. It is the responsibility of the grantee to initiate the Executive Order review
process if it proposes to use its CDBG or UDAG funds for activities subject to review.

§ 570.614 Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Currentness
(a) The Architectural Barriers Act of 1 96 8 (42 U .S .C . 4 1 5 1-4 1 5 7) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings
and other faci l ities to b e designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibi l ity to, and use by,
phys ically handicapped people. A building or faci lity designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under
this part after December I 1 , I 995, and that meets the definition of "residential structure" as defined in 24 C F R 40.2 or the
definition of"building" as defined in 4 1 CFR l O 1 - 1 9.602(a) is subject to the requirements of the Architectural B arriers Act of
1 96 8 (42 U . S . C . 4 1 5 1 -4 1 5 7 ) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR pati
40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 4 1 CFR part 1 0 1 - 1 9 , subpart 1 0 1 -1 9. 6 , for general type buildings).
( b ) The Americans with Disabil ities Act (42 U S. C . 1 2 1 3 1 ; 47 U . S . C . I 5 5 , 20 I , 2 1 8 and 225 ) (ADA) provides comprehensive
civil rights to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government
services, and telecommunications. It futiher provides that discrim ination includes a failure to design and construct facilities
for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1 993 , that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in
existing faci lities, where such removal is readily achievable-that is, easily accompl ishabl e and able to be carried out without
m uch difficulty or expense.

(a) The Federal award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:
( 1 ) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, if a non-Federal entity fails to comply with the terms and
conditions of a Federal award;
(2) By the F ederal awarding agency or pass-through entity for cause;
( 3 ) By the F ederal awarding agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the non-Federal entity, in which case the
