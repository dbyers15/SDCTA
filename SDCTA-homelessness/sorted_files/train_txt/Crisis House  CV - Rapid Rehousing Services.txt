Constitutional prohibition. The following restrictions and limitations
therefore apply to the use of CDBG-CV funds.
(1) CD BG-CV funds may not be used for the acquisition of property
or the construction or rehabilitation (including h istoric
preservation and removal of architectural barriers) of structures
to be used for religious purposes or which will otherwise
promote religious interest. This limitation includes the
acquisition of property for ownership by primarily religious
entities and the construction or rehabilitation (including h istoric
preservation and removal of architectural barriers) of structures
owned by such entities ( except as permitted under paragraph
U ) of 24 CFR 570.200 with respect to rehabilitation and under
paragraph 0) thereof with respect to repairs undertaken in
connection with public services) regardless of the use to be
made of the property or structure. Property owned by primarily
religious entities may be acquired with CDBG funds at no more
than fair market value for the non-religious use.
(I) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are
eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to
participate in the CDBG program. Neither the Federal

character or affiliation.
(ii) Organizations that are directly funded under the CDBG
program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of
the programs or services funded under this part. If a n
organization conducts such activities, the activities must be
offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or
services funded under this part, and participation must be
voluntary for the beneficiaries of the H U D-funded programs or
services.
(iii) A religious organization that participates in the CDBG
program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and
local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission,
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct CDBG funds to
support any inherently religious activities, such as worship,
religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things,
faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to
provide CDBG-funded services, without removing religious art,
icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a
CDBG-funded religious organization retains its authority over
its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its
organization's name, select its board members on a religious
basis, and include religious references in its organization's
mission statements and other governing documents.
(iv) An organization that participates in the CDBG program
shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against
a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on
the basis of religion or religiou s belief.
(v) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition,
construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that
those structures are used for inherently religious activities.
CDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or
rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those
structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this
part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently

that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the
cost of accounting requirements applicable to CDBG funds in
this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a CDBG
funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of
worship, however, are ineligible for CDBG-funded
improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the
grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of
the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing
real property disposition (see 2 CFR 200) .
(vi) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its
own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State
or local government has the option to segregate the Federal
funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are
commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.

(i) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or i mproved with CDBG funds;

(viii) [Reserved]
(ix) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and
(x) Funds col lected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households not of low
and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or pat1 of the CDBG p011ion of a public improvement.
(2) Program income does not include income earned (except for interest described in § 570.5 1 3 ) on grant advances from
the U . S . Treasury. The following items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to
the U . S . Treasury, and will not be reallocated under section 1 06(c) or (d) of the Act:
(i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U . S . Treasury;
(ii) Interest earned on loans or other forms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities determ ined
by HUD either to be inel igible or to fail to meet a national obj ective in accordance with the requirements of subpart C of
this pa11, or that fai l substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and
(iii) Interest earned on the i nvestment of amounts reimbursed to the CDBG program account prior to the use of the
reimbursed funds for eligible purposes.
( 3 ) The calculation of the amount of program income for the recipient's CDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising
activities ca1Tied out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal and/
or interest on CDBG-funded loans received from grantees if such payments are made using program income received by
the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the s ubrecipient shall be deemed to have transfe1Ted program income to the
grantee.) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used for reporting purposes, for purposes
of applying the requirement under § 570. 504( b )( 2 )( iii), and in determining limitations on planning and administration and
public services activities to be paid for with CDBG funds.
(4) Program income does not include:
(i) Any income received in a single program year by the recipient and all its subrecipients if the total amount of such
income does not exceed $25 ,000; and
(ii) Amounts generated by activities that are financed by a loan guaranteed under section 1 08 of the Act and meet one or
more of the public benefit criteria specified at § 570.209( b ) ( 2 )( v ) or are caiTied out in conj unction with a grant under section
I 08(q) in an area determined by HUD to meet the eligi bility requirements for designation as an Urban Empowerment Zone
pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, subpart B. Such exclusion shall not apply if CDBG funds are used to repay the guaranteed
loan. When such a guaranteed loan is pa11ially repaid with CDBG funds, the amount generated shall be prorated to reflect
the percentage of CDBG funds used. Amounts generated by activities financed with loans guaranteed under section I 08
which are not defined as program income shall be treated as miscellaneous revenue and shall not be subject to any of the
requirements of this part, except that the use of such funds shal l be limited to activities that are located in a revitalization

strategy area and implement a HUD approved area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 9 1 .2 1 5( e) of this title. However,
such treatment shall not affect the right of the Secretary to require the section 1 0 8 borrower to pledge such amounts
as security for the guaranteed loan. The determination whether such amounts shall constitute program income shall be
governed by the provisions of the contract required at § 570.705(b )( 1 ) .
( 5 ) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities carried
out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance (the costs of fundraising are generally unallowable under the applicable
0MB circulars referenced in 24 CFR 84.27), funds collected through special assessments used to recover the non-CDBG
portion of a public improvement, and proceeds from the disposition of real property acquired or improved with CDBG
funds when the disposition occurs after the applicable time period specified in § 5 70.503(b ) ( 8 ) for subrecipient-controlled
property, or i n § 5 70.505 for recipient-control led property.
(b) Revolving fund means a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established
for the purpose of carrying out specific activities which, in htrn, generate payments to the fund for use in carrying out the same

funds held in this account shall be considered interest earned on grant advances and must be remitted to HUD for transmittal
to the U . S . Treasury no less frequently than annually. ( Interest paid by borrowers on eligible loans made from the revolving
loan fund shall be p rogram income and treated accordingly.)
(c) Subrecipient means a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization, or a for-profit entity authorized under §
5 70.20 1 ( o ), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another subrecipient to undertake activities eligible for such assistance
under subpart C of this part. The term excludes an entity receiving CDBG funds from the recipient under the authority of §
570 .204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a subrecipient. The term includes a public agency designated by a unit of
general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of this part, but does not include contractors providing
supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D.

( c) Disposition of program income received by subrecipients. The written agreement between the recipient and the subrecipient,
as required by § 5 70 .503, shall specify whether program income received is to be returned to the recipient or retained by the
subrecipient. Where program income is to be retained by the subrecipient, the agreement shall specify the activities that will
be undertaken with the program income and that all provisions of the written agreement shall apply to the specified activities.
When the subrecipient retains program income, transfers of grant funds by the recipient to the subrecipient shall be adjusted
according to the principles described in paragraphs (b )(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Any program income on hand when the
agreement expires, or received after the agreement's expiration, shall be paid to the recipient as required by § 570.503( 6 )( 8 ).
(d) Disposition of certain program income received by urban counties. Program income derived from urban county program
activities undertaken by or within the jurisdiction of a unit of general local government which thereafter terminates its
participation in the urban county shall continue to be program income of the urban county. The urban county may transfer the
program income to the unit of general local government, upon its termination of urban county participation, provided that the
unit of general local government has become an entitlement grantee and agrees to use the program income in its own CDBG
entitlement program.
(e)( l ) Transfer of program income to Entitlement program. A unit of general local government that becomes eligible to be
an Entitlement grantee may request the state's approval to transfer State CDBG grant-generated program income to the unit
of general local government's Entitlement program. A state may approve the transfer, provided that the unit of general local
government:
( i ) Has officially elected to participate in the Entitlement grant program;
(ii) Agrees to use such program income in accordance with Entitlement program requirements; and
(iii) Has set up Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) access and agrees to enter receipt of program

(b) Relocation assistance for displaced persons at URA levels.
( I ) A displaced person shall be provided with relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the

this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a permanent move from real property that is made:
(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if applicable) to move permanently from the property, if the
move occurs after the initial official subm ission to HUD (or the State, as applicable) for grant, loan, or loan guarantee
funds under this pati that are later provided or granted.

(C) Before the date described in paragraph (b )(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee ( or State,
as applicable) detem1ines that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for
the requested activity.

and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a monthly
rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average utility costs before the
initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income; or
(2) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of
moving to and from the temporary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions of the temporary
relocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the building/complex; or

24. I 0 . In addition, a low- or moderate-income household that has been displaced from a dwelling may fi le a written request for
review of the grantee's decision to the HUD Field Office. For purposes of the State CDBG program, a low- or moderate-income
household may file a written request for review of the state recipient's decision with the State.
(g) Responsibility of grantee or State.
( 1 ) The grantee (or State, if applicable) is responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this section,
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with the provisions of this section. For
purposes of the State CDBG program, the State shall requ i re state recipients to certify that they will comply with the
requirements of this section.

24 C.F.R. § 570.611
§ 570 .611 Conflict of interest.
Effective: Janua ry 6, 2016
Currentness
( 1 ) In the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services by reci pients and by subrecipients, the conflict
of interest provisions in 2 C F R 200.3 1 7 and 200.3 1 8 , shall apply.
(2) In all cases not governed by 2 C F R 200.3 1 7 and 200 . 3 1 8 , the provisions of thi s section shall apply. Such cases include
the acquisition and disposition of real property and the provision of assistance by the recipient or by its subrecipients to
individuals, businesses, and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such assistance ( e.g., rehabilitation,
preservation, and other improvements of private properties or facilities pursuant to § 5 70.202; or grants, loans, and other
assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities pursuant to § 5 70 . 20 3 , 5 70 .204, 5 70 .45 5 , or 5 70 . 703 ( i ) ).
(b) Conflicts prohibited. The general rule is that no persons described in paragraph ( c) of this section who exercise or have
exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to CDBG activities assisted under thi s part, or who are i n a position to
pai1icipate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a financial interest
or benefit from a CDBG-assisted activity, or have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect
to a CDBG-assisted activity, or with respect to the proceeds of the CDBG-assisted activity, either for themselves or those with
whom they have business or immediate fami ly ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter. For the UDAG program, the
above restrictions shall apply to all activities that are a part of the UDAG proj ect, and shall cover any such financial interest
or benefit during, or at any time after, such person's tenure.
( c) Persons covered. The conflict of interest provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any person who is an employee,
agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the recipient, or of any designated public agencies, or of
subrecipients that are receiving funds under this part.
(d) Exceptions. Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of
this section on a case-by-case basis when it has satisfactorily met the threshold requirements of (d)( l ) of this section, taking
into account the cumulative effects of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

§ 570. 6 1 1 C o nflict of interest., 24 C . F.R. § 570.6 1 1
( 1 ) Threshold requirements. HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following
documentation:
( i ) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the
conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or
local law.
(2) Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has
satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph ( d)( l ) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an exception will
serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's program or proj ect,
taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expe1tise to the program or
project that would otherwise not be available;
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the
beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or
benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;
(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process
with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described i n paragraph (b)
of this section;
(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public
interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and
(vii ) Any other relevant considerations.

§ 570.614 Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Currentness
( a) The Architectural Barriers Act of I 968 (42 U . S .C . 4 1 5 1 -4 1 5 7) requires cettain Federal and Federally funded bu ildings
and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and use by,
physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under
this patt after December 1 1 , 1 995, and that meets the definition of "residential structure" as defined in 24 C F R 40.2 or the
definition of"building" as defined in 4 1 CFR 1 0 l - 1 9 .602(a) is subject to the requirements of the Architectural B arriers Act of
1 968 (42 U .S.C. 4 1 5 1 -4 l 57) and shal l comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR part
40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 4 1 CFR part 1 0 1- 1 9, subpart 1 0 1 - 1 9.6, for general type buildings).
(b) The Americans with D isab i l ities Act (42 U . S .C . 1 2 1 3 1 ; 47 U . S.C. 1 5 5 , 20 1 , 2 1 8 and 225 ) (ADA) provides comprehensive
civil rights to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, publi c accommodations, State and local government
se1vices, and telecommunications. It futther provides that discrimination includes a failure to design and construct facilities
for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1 993, that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in
existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable-that is, easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without
much d ifficulty or expense.

§ 200.339 Termination.
Effective: July 30, 2015
Currentness
(a) The Federal award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:
( 1 ) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, if a non-Federal entity fail s to comply with the terms and
conditions of a Federal award;
(2) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity for cause;
( 3 ) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the non-Federal entity, in which case the
two parties m ust agree upon the tem1 ination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial tennination,
the portion to be tem1inated; or
(4) By the non-Federal entity upon sending to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity written notification
setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be
terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity detennines in the case of partial te1mination
that the reduced or modified portion of the Federal award or subaward will not accomplish the purposes for which the
Federal award was made, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may terminate the Federal award in its
entirety.
(b) When a Federal awarding agency terminates a Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the nonFederal
entity's m aterial failure to comply with the Federal award tem1s and conditions, the Federal awarding agency must
repo11 the te1mination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (cmTently FAPIIS).
( 1 ) The information required under paragraph (b) of this section is not to b e reported to designated integrity and performance
system until the non-Federal entity either-
WESTLAW © 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U . S . Government Work s .
§ 200.339 Term ination., 2 C.F.R. § 200.339
( i) Has exhausted its opportunities to object or challenge the decision, see § 200.34 1 Opportunities to object, hearings
and appeals; or
(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the Federal awarding agency that it
intends to appeal the Federal awarding agency's decision to term inate.
(2) If a Federal awarding agency, after entering information into the designated integrity and performance system about
a termination, subsequently:
(i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal awarding agency must correct the information in the system
within three business days;
(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal award ing agencies, the Federal awarding
agency is strongly encouraged to amend the infonnation in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.
(3) Federal awarding agencies, shall not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public
segment of designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of
Information Act. If the non-Federal entity asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding agency who posted
the information, that some of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the
Freedom of lnfomrntion Act, the Federal awarding agency who posted the information must remove the posting within
seven calendar days of receiving the asse1iion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency must
resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.
(c) When a Federal award is terminated or partially terminated, both the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the
non-Federal entity remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in § § 200.343 Closeout and 200.344 Post-closeout
adjustments and continuing responsibilities.
