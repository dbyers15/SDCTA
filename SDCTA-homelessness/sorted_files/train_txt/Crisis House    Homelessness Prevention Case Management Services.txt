A. The purpose of Section 3 is to ensure that employment and

greatest extent feasible, be directed to low- and very lowincome
persons, particularly persons who are recipients of HUD
assistance for housing.

evidenced by their execution of this contract, the parties to this

2020-2021 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 8
collective bargaining agreement or other understanding, if any,
a notice advising the labor organization or workers'

11. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION
The Subrecipient agrees that funds provided under this contract will
not be utilized for religious activities or to promote religious interests.
Religious entities may use CDBG funds for secular activities only in
accordance with the Federal regulations specified in 24 CFR
570.200(j) as follows:
2020-2021 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 9
Constitutional prohibition. The following restrictions and limitations
therefore apply to the use of CDBG funds.
(1) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition of property or
the construction or rehabilitation (including historic preservation
and removal of architectural barriers) of structures to be used
for religious purposes or which will otherwise promote religious
interest. This limitation includes the acquisition of property for
ownership by primarily religious entities and the construction or
rehabilitation (including historic preservation and removal of
architectural barriers) of structures owned by such entities
( except as permitted under paragraph (j) of 24 CFR 570.200
with respect to rehabilitation and under paragraph (j) thereof
with respect to repairs undertaken in connection with public
services) regardless of the use to be made of the property or
structure. Property owned by primarily religious entities may be
acquired with CDBG funds at no more than fair market value for
the non-religious use.
(i) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are
eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to
participate in the CDBG program. Neither the Federal
government nor a State or local government receiving funds
under CDBG programs shall discriminate against an
organization on the basis of the organization's religious
character or affiliation.
(ii) Organizations that are directly funded under the CDBG
program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of
the programs or services funded under this part. If an
organization conducts such activities, the activities must be
offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or
services funded under this part, and participation must be
voluntary for the beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or
services.
(iii) A religious organization that participates in the CDBG
program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and
local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission,
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct CDBG funds to
2020-2021 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 1 0
support any inherently religious activities, such as worship,
religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things,
faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to
provide CDBG-funded services, without removing religious art,
icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a
CDBG-funded religious organization retains its authority over
its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its
organization's name, select its board members on a religious
basis, and include religious references in its organization's
mission statements and other governing documents.
(iv) An organization that participates in the CDBG program
shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against
a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on
the basis of religion or religious belief.
(v) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition,
construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that
those structures are used for inherently religious activities.
CDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or
rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those
structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this
part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently
religious activities, CDBG funds may not exceed the cost of
those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation
that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the
cost of accounting requirements applicable to CDBG funds in
this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a CDBG
funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of
worship, however, are ineligible for CDBG-funded
improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the
grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of
the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing
real property disposition (see 2 CFR 200).
(vi) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its
own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State
or local government has the option to segregate the Federal
funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are
commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.

12. CHANGES IN USE OF FUNDS
Changes in the use of CDBG funds must be approved by the City
Council. If the Subrecipient desires a change in the use of the CDBG
funds following approval of this Agreement, a written request must be
submitted to the City for review by the Council. No change in use of
the CDBG funds will be permitted by the City without prior formal
approval by the City, subject to the provisions of the City's adopted
Citizen Participation Plan.
13. NONDISCRIMINATION CLAUSE
The Subrecipient shall comply with all State and Federal laws
regarding nondiscrimination in the provision of services and the equal
opportunity employment of personnel.
1 4. DRUG-FREE WORKPLAC E.
Subrecipient hereby certifies to City that Subrecipient will provide a
drug-free workplace by:
a) publishing a statement notifying its employees that the unlawful
manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a
controlled substance is prohibited in Subrecipient's workplace
and specifying the actions that will be taken against employees
for violations of such prohibition;
b) establishing a drug-free awareness program to inform
employees about:

c) making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in
the performance of Services under this Agreement be given a
copy of the statement required by subparagraph (a);

otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction;
f) imposing a sanction on, or requiring the satisfactory

program by, any employee who is so convicted, as required by
4 1 U.S.C. 703; and
g) (G) making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drugfree
workplace through implementation of subparagraphs (a),
(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).
Subrecipient acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement shall be
subject to suspension of payment or termination, or both, and
Subrecipient shall be subject to suspension or debarment if the City
Manager or her official designee determines, in writing, that:
a) Subrecipient has made false certification under Section 14;
b) Subrecipient violates such certification by failing to carry out the
requirements of subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
Section 14, or
c) such a number of Subrecipient's employees have been
convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes for violations
occurring in the workplace as to indicate that Subrecipient has

For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms shall apply:
(a) Program income means gross income received by the reci pient or a subrecipient directly generated from the use of CDBG

(i) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or improved with CDB G funds;
(ii) Proceeds from the disposition of equipment purchased with CDBG funds;
(iii) Gross income from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired by the recipient or by a subrecipient with

(vi i i ) [Reserved]
(ix) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and
(x) Funds collected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households not of low
and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or pa11 of the CDBG portion of a public improvement.
(2) Program income does not include income earned ( except for interest described in § 570 . 5 1 3 ) on grant advances from
the U.S. Treasury. The following items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to
the U . S . Treasury, and will not be reallocated under section 1 06(c) or (d) of the Act:
( i ) Interest earned from the i nvestment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U . S . Treasury;
( i i ) Interest earned on l oans or other forms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities determined
by HUD either to be ineligible or to fail to meet a national objective in accordance with the requirements of subpa11 C of
this pa11, or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and
( i i i ) Interest earned on the investment of amounts reimbursed to the CDBG program account prior to the use of the
reimbursed funds for eligible purposes.
( 3 ) The calculation of the amount of program income for the recipient's CDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising
activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shal l exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal and/
or interest on CDBG-funded loans received from grantees if such payments are made using program income received by
the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transferred program income to the
grantee.) The amount o f program income derived from this calculation shall be used for repo11ing purposes, for purposes
of applying the requirement under § 5 70 . 5 04( b)(2 ) ( i i i ), and in determining l imitations on planning and administration and
public services activities to be paid for with CDBG funds.
(4) Program income does not include:
(i) Any income received in a single program year by the recipient and all its subrecipients i f the total amount of such
income does not exceed $25 ,000; and
(ii) Amounts generated by activities that are financed by a loan guaranteed under section l 08 of the Act and meet one or
more of the public benefit criteria specified at § 5 70 .209(b )(2)(v) or are carried out in conjunction with a grant under section
1 08(q) in an area determined by HUD to meet the eligibility requirements for designation as an Urban Empowerment Zone
pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, subpart B. Such exclusion shal l not apply if CDBG funds are used to repay the guaranteed
loan. When such a guaranteed loan is pa11ially repaid with CDBG funds, the amount generated shall be prorated to reflect
the percentage of CDBG funds used. Amounts generated by activities financed with loans guaranteed under section 1 0 8
which are not defined a s program income shall b e treated as miscellaneous revenue and shall not b e subj ect to any o f the
requirements of this part, except that the use of such fund s shall be lim ited to activities that are located in a revitalization

strategy area and implement a HUD approved area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 9 1 .2 1 5 ( e ) of this title. However,
such treatment shall not affect the right of the Secretary to require the section 1 08 borrower to pledge such amounts
as security for the guaranteed loan. The determination whether such amounts shall constitute program income shal l be
governed by the provisions of the contract required at § 570.705(6 )( I ).
( 5 ) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities carried
out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance (the costs of fundraising are generally unallowable under the app licable
0MB circulars referenced i n 24 CFR 84.27), funds collected through special assessments used to recover the 11011-CDBG
portion of a public improvement, and proceeds from the disposition of real property acquired or improved with CDBG
funds when the d isposition occurs after the applicable time period specified i n § 5 70 . 5 03 (b)(8) for subrecipient-control led
property, or in § 5 70.505 for recipient-contro lled prope11y.
(b) Revolving fund means a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) establ ished
for the purpose of carrying out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use i n carrying out the same
activities. Each revol ving loan fund's cash balance must be held in an interest-bearing account, and any interest paid on CDBG
funds held i n this account shall be considered interest earned on grant advances and must be remitted to HUD for transmittal
to the U . S . Treasmy no less frequently than annually. (Interest paid by borrowers on eligible loans made from the revolving
loan fund shall be program income and treated accordingly.)
(c) S ubrecipient means a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization, or a for-profit entity authorized under §
5 70 .20 I ( o ), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another subrecipient to u ndertake activities eligible for such assistance
under subpart C of t h is part. The term excludes an entity receiving CDBG funds from the recipient under the authority of §
570.204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a subrecipient. The term includes a public agency designated by a unit of
general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of thi s p art, but does not include contractors providing
supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D.

§ 570.606 D isplacement, relocation, acquisition, and replacement of housing.
Currentness
(a) General pol icy for m inim izing displacement. Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, grantees (or States
or state recipients, as applicable) shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons
(fam ilies, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms ) as a result of activities assisted under this part.
(b) Relocation assistance for displaced persons at URA levels.
( 1 ) A displaced person shall be provided with relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the
requirements of 49 C F R part 24, which contains the government-wide regul ations implementing the U nifo1111 Relocation
Ass istance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1 970 (URA) (42 U . S . C . 460 1-46 5 5 ).
(2) Displaced person.
(i) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term "displaced person" m eans any person (family, individual, business,
nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real prope1ty, or moves h i s or her personal property from real property,
permanently and involuntari ly, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demol ition, or acquisition for an activity assisted under
this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a permanent move from real propetty that is made:
(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if appl icable) to move permanently from the property, if the
move occurs after the i nitial official submission to HUD (or the State, as app l i cable) for grant, loan, or loan guarantee
funds under this pat1 that are later provided or granted.
(8) After notice by the propet1y owner to move permanently from the propetty, if the move occurs after the date of
the submission of a request for financial assistance by the property owner ( or person in control of the site) that is
later approved for the requested activity.

(C) B efore the date described in paragraph (b )(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee ( or State,
as applicable) determines that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabi litation, or demolition for
the requested activity.
(D) After the "initiation of negotiations" if the person is the tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit and any one of the
fol lowing three situations occurs:
( 1 ) The tenant has not been provided with a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable decent, safe,
and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a monthly
rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average utility costs before the
initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income; or
(2) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of
moving to and from the temporary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions of the temporary
relocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the building/complex; or
(3 ) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the building/complex, but is not offered reimbursement for
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move.
( i i ) Notwithstanding the provisions of p aragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the term "displaced person-" does not include:
(A) A person who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material tem1s of the lease
or occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this basis, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable)
must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation
assistance under this section;
(B) A person who moves into the prope1ty after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A ) or (B) of
this section, but who received a written notice of the expected displacement before occupancy.
(C) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).
(D) A person who the grantee (or State, as applicable) dete1mines is not displaced as a direct result of the acquisition,
rehabi litation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that
determination.
(iii) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) may, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a person
is a displaced person under this section.
( 3 ) Initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the type o f replacement housing assistance to be provided under
paragraph (b) of this section, if the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabi litation, demolition,

§ 570.606 Dis placement, relocation, acquisition, and ... , 24 C . F.R. § 570.606
or acquisition of real property, the term "initiation of negotiations" means the execution of the grant or loan agreement
between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the real property.
(c) Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan . The grantee shal l comply with the requirements of 24 CFR
part 42, subpa11 B .
(d) Optional relocation assistance. Under section I 05(a)( l l ) of the Act, the grantee may provide (or the State may permit the
state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by activities
that are not subject to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide (or the State may also permit the
state recipient to provide, as app licable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs (b) or ( c) of this
section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraphs. Unless such assistance is provided under State or local law, the
grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a written determination that the
assistance is appropriate ( s ee, e.g., 24 CFR 5 70 . 20 l ( i ), as applicable). The grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) must adopt
a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable)
has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.
(e) Acquisition of real prope11y. The acquisition of real prope11y for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR pat1 24, subpa11 B .
( f) Appeals . I f a person d isagrees with the determination of the grantee ( o r t h e state recipient, a s appl icable) concerning the
person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment under this section, the person may file a written appeal of that
determination with the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable). The appeal procedures to be followed are described in 49 CFR
24 . 1 0 . In addition, a low- or moderate-income household that has been displaced from a dwelling may file a written request for
review of the grantee's decision to the HUD Field Office. For purposes of the State CDBG program, a low- or moderate-income
household may file a written request for review of the state recipient's decision with the State.
(g) Responsibility of grantee or State.
( 1 ) The grantee (or State, if applicable) is responsible for ensuring compli ance with the requirements of this section,
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with the provisions of this section. For
purposes of the State CDBG program, the State shall require state recipients to ce11ify that they will comply with the
requirements of this section.
(2) The cost of assistance required under this section m ay be paid from local public funds, funds provided under th is part,
or funds available from other sources.
( 3 ) The grantee (or State and state recipient, as app l icable) must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this section.

24 C . F.R. § 570.611
§ 570 .611 Conflict of interest.
Effective: January 6, 2 0 16
Currentness
( I ) In the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services by recipients and by subrecipients, the conflict
of i nterest provisions in 2 CFR 200.3 1 7 and 200.3 1 8 , shall apply.
(2) In all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.3 1 7 and 200.3 1 8, the provisions of this section shall apply. Such cases include
the acquisition and d i sposition of real property and the provision of assistance by the recipient or by its subrecipients to
individuals, businesses, and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such assistance (e.g., rehabi litation,
preservation, and othe r improvements of private properties or facilities pursuant to § 5 70 .202 ; or grants, loans, and other
assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities pursuant to § 5 70 . 203 , 5 70 .204, 5 70.455 , or 5 70 .703( i ) ).
(b) Conflicts prohibited. The general rule is that no persons described i n paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have
exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to CDBG activities assisted under this part, or who are in a position to
pai1icipate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a financial interest
or benefit from a CDBG-assisted activity, or have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect
to a CD BG-assisted activity, or with respect to the proceeds of the CDBG-assisted activity, either for themselves or those with
whom they have business or immediate fami ly ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter. For the UDAG program, the
above restrictions shall apply to all activities that are a part of the UDAG project, and shall cover any such financial interest
or benefit during, or at any time after, such person's tenure.
(c) Persons covered. The conflict of interest provisions of p aragraph ( b ) of this section apply to any person who is an employee,
agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the recipient, or of any designated public agencies, or of
subrecipients that are receiving funds under this pa11.
(d) Exceptions. Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph ( b ) of
this section on a case-by-case basis when it has satisfactorily met the threshol d requ i rements of (d)( l ) of this section, taking
into account the cumulative effects of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

§ 570.6 1 1 Conflict of interest., 24 C.F.R. § 570.6 1 1
( 1 ) Threshold requirements. H U D w i l l consider a n exception only after the recipient has provided the following
documentation:
(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the
conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or
local law.
(2) F actors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has
satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)( l ) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an exception will
serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's program or proj ect,
taking into account the cumulative effect of the fo llowing factors, as app licable:
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expe1tise to the program or
project that would otherwise not be available;
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons i ntended to be the
beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same i nterests or
benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;
(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process
with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b)
of this section;
(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public
interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and
(vii ) Any other relevant considerations.

Currentness
(a) General. Executive Order 1 2372, I ntergovemmental Review of Federal Programs, and the Depa1tment's implementing
regulations at 24 C F R part 52, allow each State to estab l ish its own process for review and comment on proposed Federal
financial assistance programs.
(b) Applicability. Executive Order 1 2372 applies to the CDBG Entitlement program and the UDAG program. The Executive
Order applies to all activities proposed to be assisted under UDAG, but it applies to the Entitlement program only where a
grantee proposes to use funds for the planning or construction (reconstruction or installation) of water or sewer facilities. Such
facilities include storm sewers as well as all sanitary sewers, but do not include water and sewer lines connecting a structure
to the lines in the public right-of-way or easement. It is the responsibility of the grantee to initiate the Executive Order review
process if it proposes to use its CDBG or UDAG funds for activities subject to review.

§ 570 .614 Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Cun-entness
( a) The Architectural Barriers Act of 1 968 (42 U .S.C. 4 1 5 1 -4 1 5 7 ) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings
and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and use by,
physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or a ltered with funds allocated or reallocated under
this pa11 after December 1 1 , 1 995, and that meets the definition of "residential structure" as defined in 24 CFR 40.2 or the
definition of "building" as defined in 4 1 CFR 1 0 1- 1 9 .602(a) is subject to the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of
1 968 (42 U . S.C . 4 1 5 1 -4 1 5 7) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessib i l ity Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR pai1
40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 4 1 CFR part JO 1 - 1 9, subpart I O 1 - 1 9 .6, for general type buildings).
( b ) The Americans with Disabi l ities Act (42 U . S . C . 1 2 1 3 1 ; 47 U . S .C. 1 55 , 20 I , 2 1 8 and 225 ) (ADA) provides comprehensive
civil rights to individuals with disabil ities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government
services, and telecommunications. It fu11her provides that discrimination includes a failure to design and construct facilities
for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1 993, that are readi ly accessible to and usable by individuals with disabil ities .
Fu11her, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in
existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable-that is, easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without
much difficulty or expense.

§ 200.339 Termination.
Effective: July 30, 2015
Currentness
(a) The Federal award may be te1111inated in whole or in part as follows :
( 1 ) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, if a non-Federal entity fails to comply with the terms and
conditions of a Federal award;
(2) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity for cause;
(3) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the non-Federal entity, in which case the
two parties must agree upon the tennination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination,
the portion to be term inated; or
(4) By the non-Federal entity upon sending to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity written notification
setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be
terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines in the case of partial termination
that the reduced or modified portion of the Federal award or subaward will not accomplish the purposes for which the
Federal award was made, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may terminate the Federal award in its
entirety.
(b) When a Federal awarding agency terminates a Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the nonFederal
entity's material failure to comply with the Federal award te1111s and conditions, the Federal awarding agency must
report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (cmTently FAPIIS).
( 1 ) The information required under paragraph (b) of this section is not to be reported to designated integrity and performance
system until the non-Federal entity either-

§ 200.339 Te rmination., 2 C.F. R . § 200 .339
(i) Has exhausted its opportunities to obj ect or challenge the decision, see § 200.34 1 Opportunities to obj ect, hearings
and appeals; or
(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the term ination, informed the Federal awarding agency that it
intends to appeal the Federal awarding agency's decision to terminate.
(2) If a Federal awarding agency, after entering information into the designated integrity and performance system about
a termination, subsequently :
(i) Learns that any of that i nformation is erroneous, the Federal awarding agency must correct the information in the system
within three business days;
(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the Federal awarding
agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to i ncorporate the update in a timely way.
(3) Federal awarding agencies, shall not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public
segment of designated integrity and performance system that i s covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of
Information Act. If the non-Federal entity asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding agency who posted
the information, that some of the information made publ ic ly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal awarding agency who posted the information must remove the posting w ithin
seven calendar days of receiving the asse1iion . Prior to reposting the releasable inforniation, the Federal agency must
resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of lnformation Act procedures.
( c) When a Federal award i s terminated or partially terminated, both the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the
non-Federal entity remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in § § 200 .343 C loseout and 200 .344 Post-closeout
adj ustments and continuing responsibilities.
