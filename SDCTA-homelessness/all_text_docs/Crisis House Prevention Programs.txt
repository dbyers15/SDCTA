accordance with the Federal regulations specified in 24 CFR
570.200U) as follows:
2019-2020 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 9
'
Constitutional prohibition. The following restrictions and limitations
therefore apply to the use of CDBG funds.
(1) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition of property or
the construction or rehabilitation (including historic preservation
and removal of architectural barriers) of structures to be used
for religious purposes or which will otherwise promote religious
interest. This limitation includes the acquisition of property for
ownership by primarily religious entities and the construction or
rehabilitation (including historic preservation and removal of
architectural barriers) of structures owned by such entities
(except as permitted under paragraph U) of 24 CFR 570.200
with respect to rehabilitation and under paragraph U) thereof
with respect to repairs undertaken in connection with public
services) regardless of the use to be made of the property or
structure. Property owned by primarily religious entities may be
acquired with CDBG funds at no more than fair market value for
the non-religious use.
(i) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are
eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to
participate in the CDBG program. Neither the Federal
government nor a State or local government receiving funds
under CDBG programs shall discriminate against an
organization on the basis of the organization's religious
character or affiliation.
(ii) Organizations that are directly funded under the CDBG
program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of
the programs or services funded under this part. If an
organization conducts such activities, the activities must be
offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or
services funded under this part, and participation must be
voluntary for the beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or
services.
(iii) A religious organization that participates in the CDBG
program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and
local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission,
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct CDBG funds to
2019-2020 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 1 0
support any inherently religious activities, such as worship,
religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things,
faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to
provide CDBG-funded services, without removing religious art,
icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a
CDBG-funded religious organization retains its authority over
its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its
organization's name, select its board members on a religious
basis, and include religious references in its organization's
mission statements and other governing documents.
(iv) An organization that participates in the CDBG program
shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against
a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on
the basis of religion or religious belief.
(v) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition,
construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that
those structures are used for inherently religious activities.
CDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or
rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those
structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this
part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently
religious activities, CDBG funds may not exceed the cost of
those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation
that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the
cost of accounting requirements applicable to CDBG funds in
this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a CDBG
funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of
worship, however, are ineligible for CDBG-funded
improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the
grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of
the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing
real property disposition (see 2 CFR 200).
(vi) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its
own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State
or local government has the option to segregate the Federal
funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are
commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.

opportunity employment of personnel.

comply with any term(s) of the award and/or the award is terminated
for convenience. Title 2, Sections 200.338 and 200.339 of the Code

(ix) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and
(x) Funds collected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households aot of
low and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or part of the CDBG portion of a public
improvement.

transmittal to lhe U.S. Treasury, and will not be reallocated under section I 06(c) or (d) of the Act:
(i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds ofa grant advance by the U.S. Treasury;
(ii) lnterest earned on loans or other fonns of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities

of subpart C of this part, or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and
(iii) Interest earned oa lhe investment of amounts reimbursed lo Lhe CDBG program account prior lo the use of
the reimbursed funds for eligible purposes.
(3) The calculation of the amount of program income for the recipient's CDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising
activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal
and/or interest on CD BG-funded loans received from grantees if such payments are made using program income
received by the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transferred
program income to the grantee.) The amount of program income derived from trus calculation shall be used

miscellaneous revenue and shall not be subject to any of the requirements of this part, except that the use of such
funds shall be limited to activities that are located in a revitalization strategy area and implement a HUD approved
area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 9 l .215(e) of this title. However, such treatment shall not affect the right
of the Secretary to require the section 108 borrower to pledge such amounts as security for the guaranteed loan.

under § 570.20 l{o), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another subrecipient to undertake activities eligible for
such assistance under subpart C of this part. The term excludes an entity receiving CDBG funds from the recipient under
the authority of§ 570.204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a subrecipient. The term includes a public agency
designated by a unit of general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of this part, but does not
include contractors providing supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in

§ 570.606 Displacement, relocation, acquisition, and ... , 24 C.F.R. § 570.606
(3) Initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the type of replacement housing assistance to be provided
under paragraph (b) of this section, if the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation,
demolition, or acquisition of real property, the term "initiation of negotiations" means the execution of the grant or
loan agreement between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling
the real property.
(c) Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan. The grantee shall comply with the requirements of 24
CFR part 42, subpart B.

permit the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs
(b) or (c) of this section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraphs. Unless such assistance is provided under
State or local law, the grantee (or slate recipient, as applicable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a
written determination that the assistance is appropriate (see, e.g., 24 CFR 570.20 I (i), as applicable). The grantee (or
slate recipient, as applicable) must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance
that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance

with the State.

570.203, 570.204, 570.455, or 570. 703(i)).

§ 570.611 Conflict of interest., 24 C.F.R. § 570.611
(I) Threshold requirements. HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following
documentation:
(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of
the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State
or local law.
(2) Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient
has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)(l) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an
exception will serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's
program or project, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program

Currentness
(a) General. Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and the Department's
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 52, allow each State to establish its own process for review and comment on
proposed Federal financial assistance programs.
(b) Applicability. Executive Order 12372 applies to the CDBG Entitlement program and the UDAG program. The
Executive Order applies to all activities proposed to be assisted under UDAG, but it applies to the Entitlement program
only where a grantee proposes to use funds for the planning or construction (reconstruction or installation) of water or
sewer facilities. Such facilities include storm sewers as well as all sanitary sewers, but do not include water and sewer lines
connecting a structure to the lines in the public right-of-way or easement. It is the responsibility of the grantee to initiate
the Executive Order review process if it proposes to use its CDBG or UDAG funds for activities subject to review.

Currentness
{
(a) The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 41 51-41 57) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings
and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and
use by, physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or
reallocated under this part after December 1 1, 1995, and that meets the definition of "residential structure" as defined
in 24 CFR 40.2 or the definition of "building" as defined in 41 CFR 101-19.602(a) is subject to the requirements of
the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4 151--4157) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart
1 0 1-19.6, for general type buildings).
(b) The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 1 2 1 3 1 ; 47 U.S.C. 155, 201 , 218 and 225) (ADA) provides
comprehensive civil rights to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and
local government services, and telecommunications. It further provides that discrimination includes a failure to design
and construct facilities for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by
individuals with disabilities. Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers
that are structural in nature in existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable-that is, easily accomplishable
and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.

§ 200.339 Termination.
Effective: July 30, 2015
Currentness
(a) The Federal award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:
(1) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, if a non-Federal entity fails to comply with the terms
and conditions of a Federal award;
(2) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity for cause;
(3) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the non-Federal entity, in which case
the two parties must agree upon the tem1ination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial

(4) By the non-Federal entity upon sending to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity written
notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination,
the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines in the case
of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the Federal award or subaward will not accomplish
the purposes for which the Federal award was made, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may
terminate the Federal award in its entirety.
(b) When a Federal awarding agency terminates a Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to
the n o n -Federal entity's material failure to comply with the Federal award terms and conditions, the Federal awarding
agency must report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM

and appeals; or
(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the Federal awarding agency
that it intends to appeal the Federal awarding agency's decision lo terminate.
(2) If a Federal awarding agency, after entering information into the designated integrity and performance system
about a termination, subsequently:
(i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal awarding agency must correct the information in
the system within three business days;
(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the Federal
awarding agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a
timely way.
(3) FederaJ awarding agencies, shall not post any information that will be made publicly available in the nonpublic
segment of designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the
Freedom of Information Act. If the non-Federal entity asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding
agency who posted the information, that some of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure
exemption under the Freedom of Informatio11 Act, the Federal awarding agency who posted the informatio11
must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable
information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of [nfonnation
Act procedures.
(c) When a Federal award is terminated or partially terminated, both the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity
and the n o n -Federal entity remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in §§ 200.343 Closeout and 200.344
Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities.
