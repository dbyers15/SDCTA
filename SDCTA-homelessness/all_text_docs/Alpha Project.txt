A. Coverage 
We will pay all sums an "insured" legally must pay as damages because of "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance applies, caused by an "accident" and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered "auto". 
We will also pay all sums an "insured" legally must pay as a "covered pollution cost or expense" to which this insurance applies, caused by an "acci­dent" and resulting from the ownership, mainte­nance or use of covered "autos". However, we will only pay for the "covered pollution cost or ex­pense" if there is either "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance applies that is caused by the same "accident". 
We have the right and duty to defend any "in­sured" against a "suit" asking for such damages or a "covered pollution cost or expense". However, we have no duty to defend any "insured" against a "suit" seeking damages for "bodily injury" or "prop­erty damage" or a "covered pollution cost or ex­pense" to which this insurance does not apply. We may investigate and settle any claim or "suit" as we consider appropriate. Our duty to defend or settle ends when the Liability Coverage Limit of Insurance has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. 
1. Who Is An Insured 
The following are "insureds":
