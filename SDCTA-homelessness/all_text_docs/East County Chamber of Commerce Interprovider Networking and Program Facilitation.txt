Constitutional prohibition. The following restrictions and limitations
therefore apply to the use of CDBG-CV funds.
(1) CDBG-CV funds may not be used for the acquisition of property
or the construction or rehabilitation (including historic
preservation and removal of architectural barriers) of structures
to be used for religious purposes or which will otherwise
promote religious interest. This limitation includes the
acquisition of property for ownership by primarily religious
entities and the construction or rehabilitation (including historic
preservation and removal of architectural barriers) of structures
owned by such entities ( except as permitted under paragraph
U) of 24 CFR 570.200 with respect to rehabilitation and under
paragraph U) thereof with respect to repairs undertaken in
connection with public services) regardless of the use to be
made of the property or structure. Property owned by primarily
religious entities may be acquired with CDBG funds at no more
than fair market value for the non-religious use.
(i) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are
eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to
participate in the CDBG program. Neither the Federal
government nor a State or local government receiving funds
60139.00001\33575785. l

under CDBG programs shall discriminate against an
organization on the basis of the organization's religious
character or affiliation.
(ii) Organizations that are directly funded under the CDBG
program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of
the programs or services funded under this part. If an
organization conducts such activities, the activities must be
offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or
services funded under this part, and participation must be
voluntary for the beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or
services.
(iii) A religious organization that participates in the CDBG
program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and
local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission,
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct CDBG funds to
support any inherently religious activities, such as worship,
religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things,
faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to
provide CDBG-funded services, without removing religious art,
icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a
CDBG-funded religious organization retains its authority over
its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its
organization's name, select its board members on a religious
basis, and include religious references in its organization's
mission statements and other governing documents.
(iv) An organization that participates in the CDBG program
shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against
a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on
the basis of religion or religious belief.
(v) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition,
construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that
those structures are used for inherently religious activities.
CDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or
rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those
structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this
part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently

those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation
that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the
cost of accounting requirements applicable to CDBG funds in
this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a CDBG
funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of
worship, however, are ineligible for CDBG-funded
improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the
grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of
the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing
real property disposition (see 2 CFR 200).
(vi) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its
own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State
or local government has the option to segregate the Federal
funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are
commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.

Council. If the Subrecipient desires a change in the use of the CDBG
funds following approval of this Agreement, a written request must be

(vi i i ) [Reserved]
( ix ) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and
(x) Funds collected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households not of low
and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or part of the CDBG portion of a public i mprovement.
(2) Program income does not include income earned ( except for i nterest described in § 570.5 1 3 ) on grant advances from
the U.S. Treasury. The fo llowing items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to
the U . S . Treasury, and will not be reallocated under section 1 06(c) or (d) of the Act:
(i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U . S . Treasury ;
( i i ) Interest earned on loans or other fo1ms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities determined
by HUD either to be ineligible or to fail to meet a national objective in accordance with the requirements of subpart C of
this paii, or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and
( i i i ) Interest earned on the investment of amounts reimbursed to the CDBG program account prior to the use of the
reimbursed funds for eligible purposes.
( 3 ) The calculation of the amount of program income for the recipient's CDBG program as a whole ( i . e . , comprising
activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal and/
or interest on CDBG-funded loans received from grantees if such payments are made using program income received by
the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transfe1Ted program income to the
grantee.) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used for reporting purposes, for purposes
of applying the requirement under § 570.504(b)(2) ( i i i ), and in determining limitations on planning and administration and
pub l ic services activities to be paid for with CDBG funds.
(4) Program income does not include:
(i) Any income received in a single program year by the recipient and all its subrecipients if the total amount of such

loan. When such a guaranteed loan is partially repaid with CDBG funds, the amount generated shall be prorated to reflect
the percentage of CDBG funds used. Amounts generated by activities financed with loans guaranteed under section I 0 8
which are not defined a s program income shall be treated a s m iscellaneous revenue and shall not be subj ect to any o f the
requirements of this part, except that the use of such funds shall be limited to activities that are located in a revitalization

strategy area and i mplement a HUD approved area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 9 1 .2 1 5( e ) of this title. However,
such treatment shall not affect the right of the Secretary to require the section 1 08 borrower to pledge such amounts
as security for the guaranteed loan. The determination whether such amounts shall constitute program income shall be
governed by the provisions of the contract required at § 570. 705 ( b )( I ).
( 5 ) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities carried
out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance (the costs of fundraising are generally unal lowable under the applicable
0MB c irculars referenced in 24 CFR 84.27 ), funds col lected through special assessments used to recover the non-CDBG
portion of a public improvement, and proceeds from the d isposition of real property acquired or i mproved with CDBG

funds held in this account shall be considered interest earned on grant advances and must be remitted to HUD for transmittal
to the U . S . Treasury no less frequently than annually. ( Interest paid by borrowers on eligible loans made from the revolving
loan fund shall be program income and treated accordingly. )
( c ) Subrecipient means a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization, or a for-profit entity authorized under §
5 70 .20 l (o ), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another subrec ipient to undertake activities eligible for such assistance
under subpart C of thi s part. The term excludes an entity receiving CDBG funds from the recipient under the authority of §
5 70 .204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a subrecipient. The term includes a public agency designated by a unit of
general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of this p art, but does not include contractors providing
supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D.

(i) Program income in the form of repayments to, or interest earned on, a revolving fund as defined in § 570 .500(b) shall

section, income received after closeout shall not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that, if at the time of
closeout the recipient has another ongoing CDBG grant received directly from HUD, funds received after closeout shall
be treated as program income of the ongoing grant program.
( 5 ) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income received
after closeout from the d isposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall not be governed

§ 570 .606 Displacement, relocation, acquisition, and replacement of housing.
Currentness
(a) General policy for minimizing displacement. Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, grantees (or States
or state rec i pients, as applicable) shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons
(fami l ies, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of activities assi sted under this pa1t.
(b) Relocation assistance for displaced persons at URA levels.
( 1 ) A displaced person shall be provided with relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the
requirements of 49 CFR part 24, which contains the government-wide regulations implementing the Uniforn1 Relocation
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Polic ies Act of 1 970 ( U RA ) (42 U .S .C . 460 1 -4655 ).
(2) Displaced person.
( i ) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term "displaced person" means any person (family, individual, business,
nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property,
permanently and involuntarily, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for an activity assisted under
this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a permanent move from real property that is made:
(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if applicable) to move permanently from the property, if the
move occurs after the initial official submission to HUD (or the State, as applicable) for grant, loan, or loan guarantee
funds under this pai1 that are later provided or granted.
( B ) After notice by the prope11y owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs after the date of
the submission of a request for financial assistance by the property owner (or person in control of the site) that is
later approved for the requested activity.

§ 570.606 Displacement, rel ocation, acquisition, and ... , 24 C.F.R. § 570.606
(C) Before the date described in paragraph (b)( 2 )( i )(A) or (B) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee (or State,
as appl icable) determines that the displacement directly resulted from acqu isition, rehabilitation, or demol ition for
the requested activity.
( D ) After the "in itiation of negotiations" if the person is the tenant-occupant of a dwe l l ing unit and any one of the
following three s ituations occurs :
( I ) The tenant has not been provided with a reasonable oppo1iunity to lease and occupy a suitable decent, safe,
and sanitary dwe l l i ng i n the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a monthly
rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average util ity costs before the
initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income; or
(2) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses i ncurred i n connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of
moving to and from the tem porary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions of the temporary
relocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the buil ding/complex; or
(3) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the building/complex, but is not offered rei m bursement for
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move.
( i i ) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b )(2)( i ) of this section, the term "displaced person-" does not include:
(A) A person who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material tenns of the lease
or occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this bas i s, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as appl icable)
must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation
assistance under this section;
( 8 ) A person who moves into the property after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i )(A) or ( B ) of
this section, but who received a written notice of the expected d isplacement before occupancy.
( C ) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2 ).
( D ) A person who the grantee ( or State, as applicable) dete1m ines is not displaced as a direct result of the acquisition,
rehabi litation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on thi s basis, HUD must concur i n that
determ ination.
( i i i ) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as appl icable) m ay, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a person
is a displaced person under this section.
( 3 ) Initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the type o f replacement housing assistance to be provided under
paragraph (b) of this section, if the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabi l itation, demol ition,

§ 570.606 Displacement, relocation, a c q u isiti o n , a n d ... , 24 C . F.R. § 570.606
or acquisition of real property, the term "initiation of negotiations" means the execution of the grant or loan agreement
between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the real property.
(c) Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan. The grantee shal l comply with the requirements of 24 CFR
part 42, subpart B.
(d) Optional relocation assistance. Under section I 05(a)( 1 1 ) of the Act, the grantee may provide (or the State may permit the
state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by activities
that are not subj ect to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide (or the State may also permit the
state recipient to provide, as app licable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs (b) or ( c) of this
section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraphs. U n less such assistance is provided under State or local law, the
grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a written determination that the
assistance is appropriate (see, e.g., 24 CFR 5 70.2 0 1 ( i ), as appl icable). The grantee (or state recipient, as appl icable) must adopt
a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable)
has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.
(e) Acquisition of real property. The acquisition of real property for an ass isted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B .
(f) Appeals. If a person d isagrees with the determination o f the grantee (or the state recipient, a s applicable) concerning the
person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment under this section, the person may file a written appeal of that
determination with the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable). The appeal procedures to be followed are described in 49 CFR
24. 1 0 . In addition, a low- or moderate-income household that has been displaced from a dwelling may file a written request for
review of the grantee's decision to the HUD Field Office. For purposes of the State CDBG program, a low- or moderate-income
household may fil e a written request for review of the state recipient's decision with the State.
(g) Responsibility of grantee or State.
( 1 ) The grantee (or State, if applicable) is responsible for ensuring compl iance with the requirements of thi s section,
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with the provisions of this section. For
purposes of the State CDBG program, the State shall require state recipients to certify that they will comply with the
requirements of this section.
(2) The cost of assistance required under this section may be paid from local public funds, funds provided under this part,
or funds available from other sources.
( 3 ) The grantee ( or State and state recipient, as applicable) must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this section.

confl ict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and
( i i ) An opinion of the rec ipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought woul d not violate State or
local law.

(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive b idding or negotiation;
( i i i ) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the
beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will pern1it such person to receive generall y the same interests or
benefits as are being made avai lable or provided to the group or class;
( iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from h is or her functions or responsibil ities, or the decisionmaking process
with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph ( b )
of thi s section;
(vi ) Whether undue hardship w i l l result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public
interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and

Currentness
( a) The Architectural B arriers Act of 1 96 8 (42 U . S .C . 4 1 5 1 -4 1 5 7 ) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings
and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and use by,
physically handicapped people. A building or faci lity designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under
this part after December 1 1 , 1 995, and that meets the definition of "residential structure" as defined in 24 CFR 40 .2 or the
definition o f "building" as defined in 4 1 CFR 1 0 l - 1 9.602(a) is subject to the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of
1 968 ( 42 U .S .C . 4 1 5 1 -4 1 5 7 ) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibi l ity Standards ( appendix A to 24 CFR part
40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 41 CFR part 1 0 1 - 1 9 , subpart 1 0 1- 1 9.6, for general type buildings ).
(b) The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U .S .C . 1 2 1 3 1 ; 47 U .S.C . 1 5 5 , 20 I , 2 1 8 and 225 ) (ADA) provides comprehensive
civil rights to individuals with disabil ities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government
services, and telecommunications. It further provides that discrimination includes a failure to design and construct facilities
for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1 993, that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication baITiers that are structural in nature in
existing faci lities, where such removal is readily achievable- that is, easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without
much difficulty or expense.
