Obligatory Provisions

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals, the covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the Parties hereby acknowledge, City and Contractor/Service Provider hereby agree as follows:

SERVICES

Required Services. Contractor/Service Provider agrees to perform the services, and deliver to City the “Deliverables” (if any) described in the attached Exhibit A, incorporated into the Agreement by this reference, within the time frames set forth therein, time being of the essence for this Agreement. The services and/or Deliverables described in Exhibit A shall be referred to herein as the “Required Services.”

Reductions in Scope of Work. City may independently, or upon request from Contractor/Service Provider, from time to time, reduce the Required Services to be performed by the Contractor/Service Provider under this Agreement. Upon doing so, City and Contractor/Service Provider agree to meet and confer in good faith for the purpose of negotiating a corresponding reduction in the compensation associated with the reduction.

Additional Services. Subject to compliance with the City’s Charter, codes, policies, procedures and ordinances governing procurement and purchasing authority, City may request Contractor/Service Provider provide additional services related to the Required Services (“Additional Services”). If so, City and Contractor/Service Provider agree to meet and confer in good faith for the purpose of negotiating an amendment to Exhibit A, to add the Additional Services. Unless otherwise agreed, compensation for the Additional Services shall be charged and paid consistent with the rates and terms already provided therein. Once added to Exhibit A, “Additional Services” shall also become “Required Services” for purposes of this Agreement.

Standard of Care. Contractor/Service Provider expressly warrants and agrees that any and all Required Services hereunder shall be performed in accordance with the highest standard of care exercised by members of the profession currently practicing under similar conditions and in similar locations.

No Waiver of Standard of Care. Where approval by City is required, it is understood to be conceptual approval only and does not relieve the Contractor/Service Provider of responsibility for complying with all laws, codes, industry standards, and liability for damages caused by negligent acts, errors, omissions, noncompliance with industry standards, or the willful misconduct of the Contractor/Service Provider or its subcontractors.

Security for Performance. In the event that Exhibit A Section 4 indicates the need for Contractor/Service Provider to provide additional security for performance of its duties under this Agreement, Contractor/Service Provider shall provide such additional security prior to commencement of its Required Services in the form and on the terms prescribed on Exhibit A, or as otherwise prescribed by the City Attorney.

Business License. Prior to commencement of work, Contractor/Service Provider shall obtain a business license from City.

Subcontractors. Prior to commencement of any work, Contractor/Service Provider shall submit for City’s information and approval a list of any and all subcontractors to be used by Contractor/Service Provider in the performance of the Required Services. Contractor/Service Provider agrees to take appropriate measures necessary to ensure that all subcontractors and personnel utilized by the Contractor/Service Provider to complete its obligations under this Agreement comply with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, and policies, whether federal, state, or local. In addition, if any subcontractor is expected to fulfill any responsibilities of the Contractor/Service Provider under this Agreement, Contractor/Service Provider shall ensure that each and every subcontractor carries out the Contractor/Service Provider’s responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement.

Term. This Agreement shall commence on the earlier to occur of the Effective Date or Contractor/Service Provider’s commencement of the Required Services hereunder, and shall terminate when the Parties have complied with all their obligations hereunder; provided, however, provisions which expressly survive termination shall remain in effect.

COMPENSATION

General. For satisfactory performance of the Required Services, City agrees to compensate Contractor/Service Provider in the amount(s) and on the terms set forth in Exhibit A, Section 4. Standard terms for billing and payment are set forth in this Section 2.

Detailed Invoicing. Contractor/Service Provider agrees to provide City with a detailed invoice for services performed each month, within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the services were performed, unless otherwise specified in Exhibit A. Invoicing shall begin on the first of the month following the Effective Date of the Agreement. All charges must be presented in a line item format with each task separately explained in reasonable detail. Each invoice shall include the current monthly amount being billed, the amount invoiced to date, and the remaining amount available under any approved budget. Contractor/Service Provider must obtain prior written authorization from City for any fees or expenses that exceed the estimated budget.

Payment to Contractor/Service Provider.

Reimbursement of Costs. City may reimburse Contractor/Service Provider’s out-of-pocket costs incurred by Contractor/Service Provider in the performance of the Required Services if negotiated in advance and included in Exhibit A. Unless specifically provided in Exhibit A, Contractor/Service Provider shall be responsible for any and all out-of-pocket costs incurred by Contractor/Service Provider in the performance of the Required Services.

Exclusions. City shall not be responsible for payment to Contractor/Service Provider for any fees or costs in excess of any agreed upon budget, rate or other maximum amount(s) provided for in Exhibit A. City shall also not be responsible for any cost: (a) incurred prior to the Effective Date; or (b) arising out of or related to the errors, omissions, negligence or acts of willful misconduct of Contractor/Service Provider, its agents, employees, or subcontractors.

Payment Not Final Approval. Contractor/Service Provider understands and agrees that payment to the Contractor/Service Provider or reimbursement for any Contractor/Service Provider costs related to the performance of Required Services does not constitute a City final decision regarding whether such payment or cost reimbursement is allowable and eligible for payment under this Agreement, nor does it constitute a waiver of any violation by Contractor/Service Provider of the terms of this Agreement. If City determines that Contractor/Service Provider is not entitled to receive any amount of compensation already paid, City will notify Contractor/Service Provider in writing and Contractor/Service Provider shall promptly return such amount.

INSURANCE

Required Insurance. Contractor/Service Provider must procure and maintain, during the period of performance of Required Services under this Agreement, and for twelve months after completion of Required Services, the policies of insurance described on the attached Exhibit B, incorporated into the Agreement by this reference (the “Required Insurance”). The Required Insurance shall also comply with all other terms of this Section.

Deductibles and Self-Insured Retentions. Any deductibles or self-insured retentions relating to the Required Insurance must be disclosed to and approved by City in advance of the commencement of work.

Standards for Insurers. Required Insurance must be placed with licensed insurers admitted to transact business in the State of California with a current A.M. Best’s rating of A V or better, or, if insurance is placed with a surplus lines insurer, insurer must be listed on the State of California List of Eligible Surplus Lines Insurers (LESLI) with a current A.M. Best’s rating of no less than A X. For Workers’ Compensation Insurance, insurance issued by the State Compensation Fund is also acceptable.

Subcontractors. Contractor/Service Provider must include all sub-Contractor/Service Providers/sub-contractors as insureds under its policies and/or furnish separate certificates and endorsements demonstrating separate coverage for those not under its policies. Any separate coverage for sub-Contractor/Service Providers must also comply with the terms of this Agreement.

The general

liability additional insured coverage must be provided in the form of an endorsement to the Contractor/Service Provider’s insurance using ISO CG 2010 (11/85) or its equivalent; such endorsement must not exclude Products/Completed Operations coverage.

General Liability Coverage to be “Primary.” Contractor/Service Provider’s general liability coverage must be primary insurance as it pertains to the City, its officers, officials, employees, agents, and volunteers. Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by the City, its officers, officials, employees, or volunteers is wholly separate from the insurance provided by Contractor/Service Provider and in no way relieves Contractor/Service Provider from its responsibility to provide insurance.

No Cancellation. No Required Insurance policy may be canceled by either Party during the required insured period under this Agreement, except after thirty days’ prior written notice to the City by certified mail, return receipt requested. Prior to the effective date of any such cancellation Contractor/Service Provider must procure and put into effect equivalent coverage(s).

Waiver of Subrogation. Contractor/Service Provider’s insurer(s) will provide a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of the City for each Required Insurance policy under this Agreement. In addition, Contractor/Service Provider waives any right it may have or may obtain to subrogation for a claim against City.

Verification of Coverage. Prior to commencement of any work, Contractor/Service Provider shall furnish City with original certificates of insurance and any amendatory endorsements necessary to demonstrate to City that Contractor/Service Provider has obtained the Required Insurance in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The words “will endeavor” and “but failure to mail such notice shall impose no obligation or liability of any kind upon the company, its agents, or representatives” or any similar language must be deleted from all certificates. The required certificates and endorsements should otherwise be on industry standard forms. The City reserves the right to require, at any time, complete, certified copies of all required insurance policies, including endorsements evidencing the coverage required by these specifications.

Claims Made Policy Requirements. If General Liability, Pollution and/or Asbestos Pollution Liability and/or Errors & Omissions coverage are required and are provided on a claims-made form, the following requirements also apply:

The “Retro Date” must be shown, and must be before the date of this Agreement or the beginning of the work required by this Agreement.

Insurance must be maintained, and evidence of insurance must be provided, for at least five (5) years after completion of the work required by this Agreement.

If coverage is canceled or non-renewed, and not replaced with another claims-made policy form with a “Retro Date” prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the Contractor/Service Provider must purchase “extended reporting” coverage for a minimum of five (5) years after completion of the work required by this Agreement.

Not a Limitation of Other Obligations. Insurance provisions under this section shall not be construed to limit the Contractor/Service Provider’s obligations under this Agreement, including Indemnity.
