60139,00001 \341899862
2021-2022 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 9
Constitutional prohibition. The following restrictions and limitations
therefore apply to the use of CDBG funds.
(1) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition of property or
the construction or rehabilitation (including historic preservation
and removal of architectural barriers) of structures to be used
for religious purposes or which will otherwise promote religious
interest. This limitation includes the acquisition of property for
ownership by primarily religious entities and the construction or
rehabilitation (including historic preservation and removal of
architectural barriers) of structures owned by such entities
(except as permitted under paragraph 0) of 24 CFR 570.200
with respect to rehabilitation and under paragraph U) thereof
with respect to repairs undertaken in connection with public
services) regardless of the use to be made of the property or
structure. Property owned by primarily religious entities may be
acquired with CDBG funds at no more than fair market value for
the non-religious use.
(i) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are
eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to
participate in the CDBG program. Neither the Federal
government nor a State or local government receiving funds
under CDBG programs shall discriminate against an
organization on the basis of the organization's religious
character or affiliation.
(ii) Organizations that are directly funded under the CDBG
program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of
the programs or services funded under this part. If an
organization conducts such activities, the activities must be
offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or
services funded under this part, and participation must be
voluntary for the beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or
services.
(iii) A religious organization that participates in the CDBG
program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and
local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission,
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct CDBG funds to
60139.0000l\341 R99X(;.2
2021-2022 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Crisis House
Page 10
support any inheren tly religious activities, such as worship,
religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things,
faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to
provide CDBG-funded services, without removing religious art,
icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a
CDBG-funded religious organization retains its authority over
its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its
organization's name, select its board members on a religious
basis, and include religious references in its organization's
mission statements and other governing documents.
(iv) An organization that participates in the CDBG program
shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against
a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on
the basis of religion or religious belief.
(v) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition,
construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that
those structures are used for inherently religious activities.
CDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or
rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those
structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this
part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently
religious activities, CDBG funds may not exceed the cost of
those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation
that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the
cost of accounting requirements applicable to CDBG funds in
this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a CDBG
funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of
worship, however, are ineligible for CDBG-funded
improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the
grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of
the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing
real property disposition (see 2 CFR 200).
(vi) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its
own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State
or local government has the option to segregate the Federal
funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are
commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.

( l ) Threshold requirements. HUD will consider an exception only afier the recipient has provided the following
documentation:
(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the
conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or
local law.
(2) Factors to be considered for exceptions. fo determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has
satisfactorily met lhe requirements of paragraph (d)( l ) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an exception will
serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's program or project,
taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expe1tise to the program or
project that would otherwise not be available;
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the
beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or
benefits as are being made avaiJable or provided to the group or class;
(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process
with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b)
of this section;
(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public
interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and
(vii) Any other relevant considerations.
