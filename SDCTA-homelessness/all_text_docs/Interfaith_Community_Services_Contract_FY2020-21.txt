B. No other compensation for the Services will be allowed except for items covered by subsequent 
amendments to this Agreement. 
C. If the City elects to extend the Agreement, the amount shall not exceed three hundred fifteen 
thousand dollars ($315,000) per Agreement year. 
D. The City reserves the right to withhold a ten percent (10%) retention until City has accepted 
the work and/or Services specified in Exhibit "A." 
6. STATUS OF CONTRACTOR 
Contractor will perform the Services in Contractor's own way as an independent contractor and 
in pursuit of Contractor's independent calling, and not as an employee of City. Contractor will be 
under control of City only as to the result to be accomplished, but will consult with City as 
necessary. The persons used by Contractor to provide services under this Agreement will not be 
considered employees of City for any purposes. 

The payment made to Contractor pursuant to the Agreement will be the full and complete 
compensation to which Contractor is entitled. City will not make any federal or state tax 
withholdings on behalf of Contractor or its agents, employees or subcontractors. City will not be 
required to pay any workers' compensation insurance or unemployment contributions on behalf 
of Contractor or its employees or subcontractors. Contractor agrees to indemnify City within thirty 

(30) days for any tax, retirement contribution, social security, overtime payment, unemployment 
payment or workers' compensation payment which City may be required to make on behalf of 
Contractor or any agent, employee, or subcontractor of Contractor for work done under this 
Agreement. At the City’s election, City may deduct the indemnification amount from any balance 
owing to Contractor. 
7. SUBCONTRACTING 
Contractor will not subcontract any portion of the Services without prior written approval of City. 
If Contractor subcontracts any Services, Contractor will be fully responsible to City for the acts 
and omissions of Contractor's subcontractor and of the persons either directly or indirectly 
employed by the subcontractor, as Contractor is for the acts and omissions of persons directly 
employed by Contractor. Nothing contained in this Agreement will create any contractual 
relationship between any subcontractor of Contractor and City. Contractor will be responsible for 
payment of subcontractors. Contractor will bind every subcontractor and every subcontractor of 
a subcontractor by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Contractor's work unless specifically 
noted to the contrary in the subcontract and approved in writing by City. 

8. OTHER CONTRACTORS 
The City reserves the right to employ other contractors in connection with the Services. 

9. INDEMNIFICATION 
Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers, officials, employees 
and volunteers from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses including attorneys 
fees arising out of the performance of the work described herein caused by any negligence, 
recklessness, or willful misconduct of the Contractor, any subcontractor, anyone directly or 
indirectly employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable. 

The parties expressly agree that any payment, attorney’s fee, costs or expense City incurs or 
makes to or on behalf of an injured employee under the City’s self-administered workers’ 
compensation is included as a loss, expense or cost for the purposes of this section, and that this 
section will survive the expiration or early termination of this Agreement.

10. INSURANCE 
Contractor will obtain and maintain for the duration of the Agreement and any and all 
amendments, insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damage to property which may 
arise out of or in connection with performance of the services by Contractor or Contractor’s 
agents, representatives, employees or subcontractors. The insurance will be obtained from an 
insurance carrier admitted and authorized to do business in the State of California. The insurance 
carrier is required to have a current Best's Key Rating of not less than "A-:VII"; OR with a surplus 
line insurer on the State of California’s List of Approved Surplus Line Insurers (LASLI) with a rating 
in the latest Best’s Key Rating Guide of at least “A:X”; OR an alien non-admitted insurer listed by 
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) latest quarterly listings report. 

10.1 Coverage and Limits. 
Contractor will maintain the types of coverage and minimum limits indicated below, unless the 
Risk Manager or City Manager approves a lower amount. These minimum amounts of coverage 
will not constitute any limitations or cap on Contractor's indemnification obligations under this 
Agreement. City, its officers, agents and employees make no representation that the limits of the 
insurance specified to be carried by Contractor pursuant to this Agreement are adequate to 
protect Contractor. If Contractor believes that any required insurance coverage is inadequate, 
Contractor will obtain such additional insurance coverage, as Contractor deems adequate, at 
Contractor's sole expense. The full limits available to the named insured shall also be available 
and applicable to the City as an additional insured. 
10.1.1 Commercial General Liability (CGL) Insurance. Insurance written on an 
“occurrence” basis, including personal & advertising injury, with limits no less than $2,000,000 per 
occurrence. If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall apply 
separately to this project/location or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required 
occurrence limit. 
10.1.2 Automobile Liability. (if the use of an automobile is involved for Contractor's work 
for City). $2,000,000 combined single-limit per accident for bodily injury and property damage. 
10.1.3 Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability. Workers' Compensation limits as 
required by the California Labor Code. Workers' Compensation will not be required if Contractor 
has no employees and provides, to City's satisfaction, a declaration stating this. 
10.1.4 Professional Liability. Errors and omissions liability appropriate to Contractor’s 
profession with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per claim. Coverage must be maintained for a 
period of five years following the date of completion of the work. 
10.2 Additional Provisions. Contractor will ensure that the policies of insurance required under 
this Agreement contain, or are endorsed to contain, the following provisions: 
10.2.1 The City will be named as an additional insured on Commercial General Liability 
which shall provide primary coverage to the City. 
10.2.2 Contractor will obtain occurrence coverage, excluding Professional Liability, which 
will be written as claims-made coverage. 
10.2.3 This insurance will be in force during the life of the Agreement and any extensions 
of it and will not be canceled without thirty (30) days prior written notice to City sent by certified 
mail pursuant to the Notice provisions of this Agreement.

coverages, then City will have the option to declare Contractor in breach, or may purchase 
replacement insurance or pay the premiums that are due on existing policies in order to maintain

maintain insurance and City may collect these payments from Contractor or deduct the amount 
paid from any sums due Contractor under this Agreement.

17. GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS 
Contractor will keep fully informed of federal, state and local laws and ordinances and regulations 
which in any manner affect those employed by Contractor, or in any way affect the performance 
of the Services by Contractor. Contractor will at all times observe and comply with these laws, 
ordinances, and regulations and will be responsible for the compliance of Contractor's services 
with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. 

Contractor will be aware of the requirements of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986

required by this Agreement. 

18. DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PROHIBITED 
Contractor will comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations prohibiting 
discrimination and harassment. 

19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
If a dispute should arise regarding the performance of the Services the following procedure will 
be used to resolve any questions of fact or interpretation not otherwise settled by agreement 
between the parties. Representatives of Contractor or City will reduce such questions, and their 
respective views, to writing. A copy of such documented dispute will be forwarded to both parties 
involved along with recommended methods of resolution, which would be of benefit to both 
parties. The representative receiving the letter will reply to the letter along with a recommended 
method of resolution within ten (10) business days. If the resolution thus obtained is unsatisfactory 
to the aggrieved party, a letter outlining the disputes will be forwarded to the City Manager. The 
City Manager will consider the facts and solutions recommended by each party and may then opt 
to direct a solution to the problem. In such cases, the action of the City Manager will be binding 
upon the parties involved, although nothing in this procedure will prohibit the parties from seeking 
remedies available to them at law. 

20. TERMINATION 
In the event of the Contractor's failure to prosecute, deliver, or perform the Services, City may 
terminate this Agreement for nonperformance by notifying Contractor by certified mail of the 
termination. If City decides to abandon or indefinitely postpone the work or services contemplated 
by this Agreement, City may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Contractor. Upon 
notification of termination, Contractor has five (5) business days to deliver any documents owned 
by City and all work in progress to City address contained in this Agreement. City will make a 

City Attorney Approved Version 6/12/18 

June 23, 2020
5 

Item #6 Page 11 of 17

Exhibit 2 

determination of fact based upon the work product delivered to City and of the percentage of work 
that Contractor has performed which is usable and of worth to City in having the Agreement 
completed. Based upon that finding City will determine the final payment of the Agreement. 

Either party upon tendering thirty (30) days written notice to the other party may terminate this 
Agreement. In this event and upon request of City, Contractor will assemble the work product and 
put it in order for proper filing and closing and deliver it to City. Contractor will be paid for work 
performed to the termination date; however, the total will not exceed the lump sum fee payable 
under this Agreement. City will make the final determination as to the portions of tasks completed 
and the compensation to be made. 

21. COVENANTS AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES 
Contractor warrants that Contractor has not employed or retained any company or person, other 
than a bona fide employee working for Contractor, to solicit or secure this Agreement, and that 
Contractor has not paid or agreed to pay any company or person, other than a bona fide 
employee, any fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gift, or any other consideration 
contingent upon, or resulting from, the award or making of this Agreement. For breach or violation 
of this warranty, City will have the right to annul this Agreement without liability, or, in its discretion, 
to deduct from the Agreement price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of the 
fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fees, gift, or contingent fee. 

22. CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS 
By signing this Agreement, Contractor agrees that any Agreement claim submitted to City must 
be asserted as part of the Agreement process as set forth in this Agreement and not in anticipation 
of litigation or in conjunction with litigation. Contractor acknowledges that if a false claim is 
submitted to City, it may be considered fraud and Contractor may be subject to criminal 
prosecution. Contractor acknowledges that California Government Code sections 12650 et seq., 
the False Claims Act applies to this Agreement and, provides for civil penalties where a person 
knowingly submits a false claim to a public entity. These provisions include false claims made 
with deliberate ignorance of the false information or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of 
information. If City seeks to recover penalties pursuant to the False Claims Act, it is entitled to 
recover its litigation costs, including attorney's fees. Contractor acknowledges that the filing of a 
false claim may subject Contractor to an administrative debarment proceeding as the result of 
which Contractor may be prevented to act as a Contractor on any public work or improvement for 
a period of up to five (5) years. Contractor acknowledges debarment by another jurisdiction is 
grounds for City to terminate this Agreement. 

23. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
Any action at law or in equity brought by either of the parties for the purpose of enforcing a right 
or rights provided for by this Agreement will be tried in a court of competent jurisdiction in the 
County of San Diego, State of California, and the parties waive all provisions of law providing for 
a change of venue in these proceedings to any other county. 

24. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS 
It is mutually understood and agreed that this Agreement will be binding upon City and Contractor 
and their respective successors. Neither this Agreement nor any part of it nor any monies due or 
to become due under it may be assigned by Contractor without the prior consent of City, which 
shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

25. ENTIRE AGREEMENT 
This Agreement, together with any other written document referred to or contemplated by it, along 
with the purchase order for this Agreement and its provisions, embody the entire Agreement and

understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter of it. In case of conflict, the terms
