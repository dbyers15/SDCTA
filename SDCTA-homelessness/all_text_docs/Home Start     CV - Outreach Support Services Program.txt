REFERENCE :  Adopted 7 /26/94 Amended 11/29/05 Amended 04/14/15  EFFECTIVE 04/14/15  PAGE 1 of 8  


PURPOSE 
To provide a uniform City policy for liability insurance requirements and to establish procedures for its consistent application. 

BACKGROUND 
To help protect the City against liability, all individuals, contractors, agencies and organizations conducting business in association with, on behalf of, or in certain circumstances within the City of El Cajon are required to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage acceptable to the City. 
Because of the differing levels of protection needed for various activities conducted within the City, the City has established policy limits and standards which directly relate to the type of activity being conducted. 

POLICY 
All individuals, contractors, agencies, and organizations conducting business either for the City of El Cajon (or the Successor Agency to the El Cajon Redevelopment Agency) or pursuant to an ordinance, resolution, agreement or policy requiring the maintenance of liability insurance shall provide proof of liability insurance in the following amounts and written on an occurrence basis (claims made coverage will be accepted only after verifying that occurrence coverage is not available): 
1. A combined single limit policy with aggregate limits in the amount of $2 million for all construction projects and for carnivals, subdivisions, and pollution coverage subject to section 5.c. under the heading "INSURANCE STANDARDS,"ewith a m?ximum deductible or self-insurance retention ("SIR") of $500,000; for policies not having a "combined single limit," minimum limits in amounts as follows: 
Commercial General Liability (CGL): Insurance Services Office Form CG 00 01 covering CGL on an "occurrence" basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury and personal & advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence. If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall 
. apply separately to this project/location or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit. 
Unless staff determines that circumstances (i.e. high risk project, etc.) require the higher limit, the $2,000,000 limit shall be decreased to $1,000,000 with a maximum deductible or SIR of $150,000, when:

b.  A construction project (in accordance with the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction-and the Standard Special Provisions, the "Green Book") is for less than $50,000.  

Except as otherwise provided in this policy, a combined single limit policy with aggregate limits in the amount of $2 million for all others, including, but not limited to, athletic leagues, recreation groups, towing companies and public service agencies; for policies not having a "combined single limit/' minimum limits in amounts as follows: 
Commercial General Liability (CGL): Insurance Services Office Form CG 00 01 covering CGL on an "occurrence" basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury and personal & advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence. If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this project/location or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit. 
3. 
A combined single limit policy with aggregate limits in the amount of $250,000 for homeowners insurance or $500,000 for commercial general liability insurance for small business owners, in either event only where the insurance is required for work in the public right-of-way. "Small business owners" are defined as commercial businesses, or a professional or administrative office uses, where the owners of the business work on-site as their primary calling or vocation, and having no more than two (2) employees not related by blood or marriage. 

4. 
Selected high-risk activities that would otherwise fall under the criteria for category 2 shall be evaluated by staff on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not the above limits are sufficient. The imposition of liability limits exceeding $2 million for such high-risk activities is appealable to the City Council. 

5. 
$1,000,000 for taxicab companies. 

6. 
$500,000 or actual value, whichever is greater, for "valuable papers" and "in transit" insurance where City records or personal property is being transported or stored outside of City property.

TIME LIMITSe/ CANCELLATION PROVISIONS 
All liability insurance required pursuant to this policy shall provide coverage for a sufficient time period to protect the City from liability. The insurer is required to provide a minimum of thirty (30) days-notice of cancellation of any policy. With the approval of the City Attorney (except as provided in section 4, herein) this obligation may be reduced to not less than ten (10) days written notice, but only for termination due to the non-payment of any premium. In no event shall a policy be accepted which terminates prior to the completion of the activity to be covered. 
In certain circumstances, it may be impracticable to obtain continuing insurance coverage due to the duration of the activity or the cost of premature renewal. Under such circumstances, an exception to the coverage period may be made so long as the policy is renewed or replaced with an acceptable insurance carrier and there is no lapse in coverage. Maintenance of proper insurance coverage is a material term of any contract with the City and failure to maintain or renew coverage or to provide evidence of renewal may be treated as a material breach of contract. 

ALTERNATIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; SELF-INSURANCE: RISK-POOLING 
Alternative risk management practices, such as self-insurance, risk pooling, risk retention groups, and other such programs, will be accepted in lieu of commercial insurance policies provided that the coverage meets the requirements of this Policy. Any such alternative risk management practices must meet the financial strength and surplus requirements reflected by the Best's Ratings required of commercial insurance under this Policy.
