Incremental payments, if applicable, should be made as outlined in attached Exhibit "A". 

6. STATUS OF CONTRACTOR 
Contractor will perform the Services in Contractor's own way as an independent contractor and 
in pursuit of Contractor's independent calling, and not as an employee of City. Contractor will be 
under control of City only as to the result to be accomplished, but will consult with City as 
necessary. The persons used by Contractor to provide services under this Agreement will not be 
considered employees of City for any purposes. 

The payment made to Contractor pursuant to the Agreement will be the full and complete 
compensation to which Contractor is entitled. City will not make any federal or state tax 
withholdings on behalf of Contractor or its agents, employees or subcontractors. City will not be 
required to pay any workers' compensation insurance or unemployment contributions on behalf 
of Contractor or its employees or subcontractors. Contractor agrees to indemnify City within thirty

(30) days for any tax, retirement contribution, social security, overtime payment, unemployment 
payment or workers' compensation payment which City may be required to make on behalf of 
Contractor or any agent, employee, or subcontractor of Contractor for work done under this 
Agreement. At the City's election, City may deduct the indemnification amount from any balance 
owing to Contractor. 
7. SUBCONTRACTING 
Contractor will not subcontract any portion of the Services without prior written approval of City. 
If Contractor subcontracts any of the Services, Contractor will be fully responsible to City for the 
acts and omissions of Contractor's subcontractor and of the persons either directly or indirectlyemployed by the subcontractor, as Contractor is for the acts and omissions of persons directly 
employed by Contractor. Nothing contained in this Agreement will create any contractual 
relationship between any subcontractor of Contractor and City. Contractor will be responsible for 
payment of subcontractors. Contractor will bind every subcontractor and every subcontractor of 
a subcontractor by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Contractor's work unless specificallynoted to the contrary in the subcontract and approved in writing by City. 

8. OTHER CONTRACTORS 
The City reserves the right to employ other Contractors in connection with the Services. 

9. INDEMNIFICATION 
Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers, officials, employees 
and volunteers from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses including attorneys 
fees arising out of the performance of the work described herein-caused by any negligence, 
recklessness, or willful misconduct of the Contractor, any subcontractor, anyone directly or 
indirectly employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable. 

The parties expressly agree that any payment, attorney's fee, costs or expense City incurs or 
makes to or on behalf of an injured employee under the City's self-administered workers' 
compensation is included as a loss, expense or cost for the purposes of this section, and that this 
section will survive the expiration or early termination of this Agreement. 

10. INSURANCE 
Contractor will obtain and maintain for the duration of the Agreement and any and all 
amendments, insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damage to property which may 
arise out of or in connection with performance of the services by Contractor or Contractor's 

agents, representatives, employees or subcontractors. The insurance will be obtained from an 

insurance carrier admitted and authorized to do business in the State of California. The insurance

10.1 Coverage and Limits. 
Contractor will maintain the types of coverage and minimum limits indicated below, unless the 
Risk Manager or City Manager approves a lower amount. These minimum amounts of coverage 
will not constitute any limitations or cap on Contractor's indemnification obligations under this 
Agreement. City, its officers, agents and employees make no representation that the limits of the 
insurance specified to be carried by Contractor pursuant to this Agreement are adequate to 
protect Contractor. If Contractor believes that any required insurance coverage is inadequate, 
Contractor will obtain such additional insurance coverage, as Contractor deems adequate, at 
Contractor's sole expense. The full limits available to the named insured shall also be available 
and applicable to the City as an additional insured. 
10.1.1 Commercial General Liability Insurance. $2,000,000 combined single-limit peroccurrence for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage. If the submitted policies contain

for City). $1,000,000 combined single-limit per accident for bodily injury and property damage.

profession with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per claim. Coverage must be maintained for a 
period of five years following the date of completion of the work. 
10.2 Additional Provisions. Contractor will ensure that the policies of insurance required under 
this Agreement contain, or are endorsed to contain, the following provisions: 
10.2.1 The City will be named as an additional insured on Commercial General Liability 
which shall provide primary coverage to the City. 
10.2.2 Contractor will obtain occurrence coverage, excluding Professional Liability, which 
will be written as claims-made coverage. 
10.2.3 This insurance will be in force during the life of the Agreement and any extensions 
of it and will not be canceled without thirty (30) days prior written notice to City sent by certified 
mail pursuant to the Notice provisions of this Agreement. 
10.3 Providing Certificates of Insurance and Endorsements. Prior to City's execution of this 
Agreement, Contractor will furnish certificates of insurance and endorsements to City. 
10.4 Failure to Maintain Coverage. If Contractor fails to maintain any of these insurance 
coverages, then City will have the option to declare Contractor in breach, or may purchase

between the parties. Representatives of Contractor or City will reduce such questions, and their 
respective views, to writing. A copy of such documented dispute will be forwarded to both parties 
involved along with recommended methods of resolution, which would be of benefit to both 
parties. The representative receiving the letter will reply to the letter along with a recommended 
method of resolution within ten (10) business days. If the resolution thus obtained is unsatisfactory

notification of termination, Contractor has five (5) business days to deliver any documents owned

determination of fact based upon the work product delivered to City and of the percentage of work 
that Contractor has performed which is usable and of worth to City in having the Agreement 
completed. Based upon that finding City will determine the final payment of the Agreement. 

Either party upon tendering thirty (30) days written notice to the other party may terminate this 
Agreement. In this event and upon request of City, Contractor will assemble the work product and 
put it in order for proper filing and closing and deliver it to City. Contractor will be paid for work
