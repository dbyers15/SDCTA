To help protect the City against liability, all individ uals, contractors , agencies and organizations
conducting business in association with , on behalf of, or in certain ci rcumstances within the City of
El Cajon are req uired to maintain adequate liability insurance covera ge accepta ble to the City.
Because of the differing levels of protection needed fo r various activities conducted within the City,
the City has established policy limits and standard s which directly relate to the type of activity
being conducted.
POLICY
All individ uals, contractors , agencies , and organizations cond ucting bu siness either for the City of
El Cajon (or the Successor Agency to the El Cajon Redevelopment Agency) or pursuant to an
ordina nce, reso lution, agreement or policy req uiring the mainte nance of liability insurance shall
provide proof of liability insurance in the following amou nts and written on an occurrence basis
(claims made cove rage will be accepted only after verifying that occurrence coverage is not
available) :

co nstruction projects and for carnivals, subdivisions, and pollution coverage subject to
secti on 5.c. under the heading "INSURANCE STAN DARDS," with a m?ximum ded uctible
or self-insurance retention ("SIR") of $500,000; for policies not having a "combined single

CGL on an "occurrence" basis, including prod ucts and co mplete d operations, property
damage, bodily injury and personal & advertising injury with limits no less than $1 ,000,000
per occu rrence. If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall
apply separately to this project/location or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the
re quired occu rre nce limit.
Unless staff dete rmines that circumsta nces (i.e. high risk project, etc.) req uire the higher
limit, the $2,000,000 limit shall be decreased to $1 ,000,000 with a maximum deductible or
SIR of $150,000, when:
