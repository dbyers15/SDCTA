Legal actions concerning any dispute, claim or matter arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be instituted in the Superior Court of the County of San Diego, State of California, the United States District Court for the San Diego District of California, or any other appropriate court in San Diego County, and Subrecipient covenants and agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such court in the event of such action. 
7.2 Disputes. In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, the injured party shall notify the insuring party in writing of its contentions by submitting a claim therefor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may suspend any further payment of CDBG funds until Subrecipient is in compliance with this Agreement. Compliance with the provisions of this Section shall be a condition precedent to termination of this Agreement for cause and to any legal action, and such compliance shall not be a waiver of any party's right to take legal action in the event that the depute is not cured. 
7.3 Remedies Upon Default by Subrecipient. In addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, if Subrecipient fails to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, City may, after compliance with the provisions of Section 7.2: 
a. Temporarily withhold payment of CDBG funds pending correction of the 
default by Subrecipient; 
10

d.  Withhold further awards for the Project and/or the facility; and  
e.  Require Subrecipient to repay any CDBG funds which the City determines  

were not expended in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act or the regulations. 
Termination. 
a. For Cause. The City may terminate the Agreement in whole, or in part, whenever the City determines that the Subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement. 
b. For Convenience.The Parties may terminate the Agreement in whole, or in part, when all parties agree that the continuation of the Project would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the future disbursement of funds. 
c. Due to Reduction or Termination of CDBG Funding.At the discretion of the City, the Agreement may be terminated in whole, or in part, if there is a reduction or termination of CDBG Federal block grant funds to the City. 
7.5 Waiver. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by a nondefaulting party on any default shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver. A party's consent to or approval of any act by the other party requiring the party's consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the other party's consent to or approval of any subsequent act. Any waiver by either party of any default must be in writing and shall not be a waiver of any other default concerning the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 
7.6 Rights and Remedies are Cumulative. Except with respect to rights and remedies expressly declared to be exclusive in this Agreement, the rights and remedies of the parties are cumulative and the exercise by either party of one or more of such rights or remedies shall not preclude the exercise by it, at the same or different times, of any other rights or remedies for the same default or any other default by the other party. 
7.7 Legal Action. In addition to any other rights or remedies, either party may take legal action, in law or in equity, to cure, correct or remedy any default, to recover damages for any default, to complete specific performance of this Agreement, to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief, or to obtain any other remedy consistent with the purposes of the Agreement.

(2) The coverage afforded by this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional insured(s)' own insurance. 
Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to other insurance to which the additional insured(s) has been 
added as an additional insured or to other insurance described in paragraph b. below.

(a) 
That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder's Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for "your work"; 

(b) 
That is fire, lightning, or explosion insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; 

(c) 
That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for "property damage" to premises temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or 

(d) 
If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, "autos" or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of SECTION 1-COVERAGE A-BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. 

(e) 
Any other insurance available to an additional insured(s) under this Endorsement covering liability for damages which are subject to this endorsement and for which the additional insured{s) has been added as an additional insured by that other insurance. 

(1) 
When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the additional insured(s) against any "suit" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the additional insured(s) against that "suit". If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the additional insured(s)' rights against all those other insurers.

The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and 

(b) 
The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance. 

(3) 
We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part. 


c. Methods of Sharing 
If all of the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) permits contribution by equal 
shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal 
amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever 
comes first. 
If any other the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) does not permit contribution by 
equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the 
ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

ADDITIONAL INSURED 
PRIMARY AND NON-CONTRIBUTORY ENDORSEMENT FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES 
This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following: 
COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART 
A. SECTION II -WHO IS AN INSURED is amended to include any public entity as an additional insured for whom you are performing operations when you and such person or organization have agreed in a written contract or written agreement that such public entity be added as an additional insured(s) on your policy, 
but only with respect to liability for "bodily injury", "property damage" or "personal and advertising injury" caused, in whole or in part, by: 
1. 
Your negligent acts or omissions; or 

2. 
The negligent acts or omissions of those acting on your behalf; in the performance of your ongoing operations. 


No such public entity is an additional insured for liability arising out of the "products-completed 
operations hazard" or for liability arising out of the sole negligence of that public entity. 
B. With respect to the insurance afforded to these additional insured(s), the following additional exclusions apply. 
This insurance does not apply to "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurring after: 
1. 
All work, including materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work, on the project (other than service, maintenance or repairs) to be performed by or on behalf of the additional insured(s) at the location of the covered operations has been completed; or 

2. 
That portion of "your work" out of which injury or damage arises has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor engaged in performing operations for a principal as a part of the same project. 


C. The following is added to SECTION Ill -LIMITS OF INSURANCE: 
The limits of insurance applicable to the additional insured(s) are those specified in the written contract between you and the additional insured(s), or the limits available under this policy, whichever are less. These limits are part of and not in addition to the limits of insurance under this policy. 
D. With respect to the insurance provided to the additional insured(s), Condition 4. Other Insurance of SECTION IV -COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS is replaced by the following: 
4. Other Insurance 
a. Primary Insurance 
This insurance is primary if you have agreed in a written contract or written agreement: 
NIAC-E61 12 15 Page 1 of 2 
(1) 
That this insurance be primary. If other insurance is also primary, we will share with all that 

other insurance as described in c. below; or 

(2) 
The coverage afforded by this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional 


insured(s)' own insurance. 
Paragraphs (1) and (2} do not apply to other insurance to which the additional insured{s} has been added as an additional insured or to other insurance described in paragraph b. below. 
b. Excess Insurance 
This insurance is excess over: 
1. Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis: 
(a} That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder's Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for "your work"; 
{b) That is fire, lightning, or explosion insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; 
(c} That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for "property damage" to premises temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or 
(d) 
If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, "autos" or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of SECTION I -COVERAGE A-BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. 

(e) 
That is any other insurance available to an additional insured(s) under this Endorsement covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations, or products­completed operations, for which the additional insured(s) has been added as an additional insured by that other insurance. 


(1) When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the additional insured(s) against any "suit'' if any other insurer has a duty to defend the additional insured{s) against that "suit". If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the additional insured(s)' rights against all those other insurers. 
(2} When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of: 
(a) 
The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and 

(b) 
The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance. 


(3) We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part. 
c. Methods of Sharing If all of the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first. 
If any other the other insurance available to the additional insured(s} does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.
