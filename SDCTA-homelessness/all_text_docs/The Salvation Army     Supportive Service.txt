BACKGROUND 
To help protect the City against liability, all individuals, contractors, agencies and organizations conducting business in association with, on behalf of, or in certain circumstances within the City of El Cajon are required to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage acceptable to the City. 
Because of the differing levels of protection needed for various activities conducted within the City, the City has established policy limits and standards which directly relate to the type of activity being conducted.

1. A combined single limit policy with aggregate limits in the amount of $2 million for all construction projects and for carnivals, subdivisions, and pollution coverage subject to section 5.c. under the heading "INSURANCE STANDARDS," with a maximum deductible or self-insurance retention ("SIR") of $500,000; for policies not having a "combined single limit," minimum limits in amounts as follows: 
Commercial General Liability (CGL): Insurance Services Office Form CG 00 01 covering CGL on an "occurrence" basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury and personal & advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence. If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this project/location or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit. 
Unless staff determines that circumstances (i.e. high risk project, etc.) require the higher limit, the $2,000,000 limit shall be decreased to $1,000,000 with a maximum deductible or SIR of $150,000, when:

Commercial General Liability (CGL): Insurance Services Office Form CG 00 01 covering CGL on an "occurrence" basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury and personal & advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence.

4. 
Selected high-risk activities that would otherwise fall under the criteria for category 2 shall be evaluated by staff on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not the above limits are sufficient. The imposition of liability limits exceeding $2 million for such high-risk activities is appealable to the City Council. 

5. 
$1,000,000 for taxicab companies. 


$500,000 or actual value, whichever is greater, for "valuable papers" and "in transit" 
insurance where City records or personal property is being transported or stored outside of

c. POLLUTION EXCLUSION 
Applications for the installation of monitoring wells for the evaluation of groundwater pollution or for the discharge of formerly polluted groundwater into the City sewer system must be accompanied by a certificate of liability insurance provided by the property owner. Such liability insurance may not contain a pollution exclusion clause and must explicitly indemnify the City against all hazards which may result from either of these activities, including a worsening of pollution, either within the subsurface adjacent to the original pollution or within the City sewer system. 
If the property owner is unable to provide insurance which addresses both general liability and pollution liability, the environmental company or other appropriately qualified entity contracting with the property owner for either monitoring well installation or groundwater pollution remediation, may furnish pollution liability insurance on behalf of the property owner. 
Any insurance approved under this subsection c. shall be an occurrence policy, and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of this Policy. 
d. PUBLIC UTILITIES 
This policy as it relates to work in the public rights-of-way shall not be applicable to Cable TV, Helix Water District, Padre Dam Municipal Water District, SBC, San Diego Gas & Electric, or any other public utility. 
e. TRANSPORTATION/ OVERSIZE LOADSe-PERMITS-See Chapter 10.24 of the El Cajon Municipal Code.

TIME LIMITS/ CANCELLATION PROVISIONS 
All liability insurance required pursuant to this policy shall provide coverage for a sufficient time period to protect the City from liability. The insurer is required to provide a minimum of thirty (30) days-notice of cancellation of any policy. With the approval of the City Attorney (except as provided in section 4, herein) this obligation may be reduced to not less than ten (10) days written notice, but only for termination due to the non-payment of any premium. In no event shall a policy be accepted which terminates prior to the completion of the activity to be covered. 
In certain circumstances, it may be impracticable to obtain continuing insurance coverage due to the duration of the activity or the cost of premature renewal. Under such circumstances, an exception to the coverage period may be made so long as the policy is renewed or replaced with an acceptable insurance carrier and there is no lapse in coverage. Maintenance of proper insurance coverage is a material term of any contract with the City and failure to maintain or renew coverage or to provide evidence of renewal may be treated as a material breach of contract. 
ALTERNATIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; SELF-INSURANCE; RISK-POOLING 
Alternative risk management practices, such as self-insurance, risk pooling, risk retention groups, and other such programs, will be accepted in lieu of commercial insurance policies provided that the coverage meets the requirements of this Policy. Any such alternative risk management practices must meet the financial strength and surplus requirements reflected by the Best's Ratings required of commercial insurance under this Policy.
