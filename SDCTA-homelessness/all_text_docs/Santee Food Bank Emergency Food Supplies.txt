1 1 . RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION
The Subrecipient agrees that funds provided under this contract will
not be utilized for religious activities or to promote religious interests.
Religious entities may use CDBG funds for secular activities only in
accordance with the Federal regulations specified in 24 CFR
570.2000) as follows:
201 9-2020 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Santee Food Bank
Page 9
Constitutional prohibition. The following restrictions and limitations
therefore apply to the use of CDBG funds.
(1) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition of property or
the construction or rehabilitation (including historic preservation
and removal of architectural barriers) of structures to be used
for religious purposes or which will otherwise promote religious
interest. This limitation includes the acquisition of property for
ownership by primarily religious entities and the construction or
rehabilitation (including historic preservation and removal of
architectural barriers) of structures owned by such entities
( except as permitted under paragraph U) of 24 CFR 570.200
with respect to rehabilitation and under paragraph U) thereof
with respect to repairs undertaken in connection with public
services) regardless of the use to be made of the property or
structure. Property owned by primarily religious entities may be
acquired with CDBG funds at no more than fair market value for
the non-religious use.
(i) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are
eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to
participate in the CDBG program. Neither the Federal
government nor a State or local government receiving funds
under CDBG programs shall discriminate against an
organization on the basis of the organization's religious
character or affiliation.
(ii) Organizations that are directly funded under the CDBG
program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of
the programs or services funded under this part. If an
organization conducts such activities, the activities must be
offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or
services funded under this part, and participation must be
voluntary for the beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or
services.
(iii) A religious organization that participates in the CDBG
program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and
local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission,
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct CDBG funds to
2019-2020 CDBG Subrecipient Contract
Santee Food Bank
Page 10
support any inherently religious activities, such as worship,
religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things,
faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to
provide CDBG-funded services, without removing religious art,
icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a
CDBG-funded religious organization retains its authority over
its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its
organization's name, select its board members on a religious
basis, and include religious references in its organization's
mission statements and other governing documents.
(iv) An organization that participates in the CDBG program
shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against
a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on
the basis of religion or religious belief.
(v) CDBG funds may not be used for the acquisition,
construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that
those structures are used for inherently religious activities.
CDBG funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or
rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those
structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this
part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently
religious activities, CDBG funds may not exceed the cost of
those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation
that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the
cost of accounting requirements applicable to CDBG funds in
this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a CDBG
funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of
worship, however, are ineligible for CDBG-funded
improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the
grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of
the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing
real property disposition (see 2 CFR 200).
(vi) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its
own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State
or local government has the option to segregate the Federal
funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are
commi ngled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.

the CDBG funds will be permitted by the City without prior formal
approval by the City, subject to the provisions of the City's adopted
Citizen Participation Plan.

regarding nondiscrimination in the provision of services and the equal
opportunity employment of personnel.
14. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.338 and 200.339, this Agreement may
be suspended or terminated if the Subrecipient materially fails to
comply with any term(s) of the award and/or the award is terminated
for convenience. Title 2, Sections 200.338 and 200.339 of the Code
of Federal Regulations are incorporated herein by reference as
provisions of this Agreement and are included as Attachment 5.

the Subrecipient shall transfer to the City any CDBG funds on hand
as of the last day of the Period of Performance and any accounts
receivable attributable to the use of CDBG funds. The Subrecipient
shall be required to use any real property under the Subrecipient's

funds in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as
follows:

24 C.F.R. § 570.500
§ 570.500 Definitions.
Effective: January 6, 2016
Currentness
For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms shall apply:
(a) Program income means gross income received by the recipient or a subrecipieut directly generated from the use of
CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(1) Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(i) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or improved with CDBG
funds;
(ii) Proceeds from the disposition of equipment purchased with CDBG funds;
(iii) Gross income from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired by the recipient or by a subrecipient
with CDBG funds, less costs incidental to generation of the income;
(iv) Gross income from the use or rental of real property, owned by the recipient or by a subrecipient, that was
constructed or improved with CD BG funds, less costs incidental to generation of the income;
(v) Payments of principal and interest on loans made using CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)
of this section;
(vi) Proceeds from the sale of loans made with CDBG funds;
(vii) Proceeds from sale of obligations secured by loans made with CDBG funds;

§ 570.500 Definitions., 24 C.F.R. § 570.500
(viii) [Reserved]
(ix) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and
(x) Funds collected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households not of
low and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or part of the CDBG portion of a public
improvement.
(2) Program income does not include income earned (except for interest described in § 570. 513) on grant advances
from the U.S. Treasury. The following items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for
transmittal to the U.S. Treasury, and wiJI not be reallocated under section I 06(c) or (d) of the Act:
(i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U.S. Treasury;
(ii) Interest earned on loans or other forms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities
determined by HUD either to be ineligible or to fail to meet a national objective in accordance with the requirements
of subpart C of this part, or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and
(iii) Interest earned on the investment of amounts reimbursed to the CDBG program account prior to the use of
the reimbursed funds for eligible purposes.
(3) The calculation of the amount of program income for the recipient's CDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising
activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal
and/or interest on CD BG-funded loans received from grantees if such payments are made using program income
received by the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transferred
program income to the grantee.) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used
for reporting purposes, for purposes of applying the requirement under § 570.504(b)(2)(iii), and in determining
limitations on planning and administration and public services activities to be paid for with CDBG funds.
(4) Program income does not include:
(i) Any income received in a single program year by the recipient and all its subrecipients if the total amount of such
income does not exceed $25,000; and
(ii) Amounts generated by activities that are financed by a loan guaranteed under section 108 of the Act and meet
one or more of the public benefit criteria specified at § 570.209(b)(2)(v) or are carried out in conjunction with a
grant under section 108(q) in an area determined by HUD to meet the eligibility requirements for designation as
an Urban Empowerment Zone pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, subpart B. Such exclusion shall not apply ifCDBG
funds are used to repay the guaranteed loan. When such a guaranteed loan is partially repaid with CDBG funds, the
amount generated shall be prorated to reflect the percentage of CD BG funds used. Amounts generated by activities
financed with loans guaranteed under section 108 which are nol defined as program income shall be treated as
\IVESTLAW © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2
§ 570.500 Definitions., 24 C.F.R. § 570,500
miscellaneous revenue and shall not be subject to any of the requirements of this part, except that the use of such
funds shall be limited to activities that are located in a revitalization strategy area and implement a HUD approved
area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 9 l.215(e) of this title. However, such treatment shall not affect the right
of the Secretary to require the section 108 borrower· to pledge such amounts as security for the guaranteed loan.
The determination whether such amounts shall constitute program income shall be governed by the provisions of
the contract required at§ 570.705(b)(l).
(5) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities
carried out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance (the costs offundraising are generally unallowable under the
applicable 0MB circulars referenced in 24 CFR 84.27), funds collected through special assessments used to recover
the non-CD BG portion of a public improvement, and proceeds from the disposition of real property acquired or
improved with CDBG funds when the disposition occurs after the applicable time period specified in§ 570.503(b)
(8) for subrecipient-controlled property, or in§ 570.505 for recipient-controlled property.
(b) Revolving fund means a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts)
established for the purpose of carrying out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use in
carrying out the same activities. Each revolving loan fund's cash balance must be held in an interest-bearing account, and
any interest paid on CDBG funds held in this account shall be considered interest earned on grant advances and must
be remitted to HUD for transmittal to the U.S. Treasury no less frequently than annually. (Interest paid by borrowers
on eligible loans made from the revolving loan fund shall be program income and treated accordingly.)
(c) Sub recipient means a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization, or a for-profit entity authorized
under § 570.20 l(o ), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another sub recipient to undertake activities eligible for
such assistance under subpart C of this part. The term excludes an entity receiving CD BG funds from the recipient under
the authority of§ 570.204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a sub recipient. The term includes a public agency
designated by a unit of general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of this part, but does not
include contractors providing supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in
2 CFR part 200, subpart D.

(3) Program income on hand at the time of closeout shall continue to be subject to the eligibility requirements in
subpart C and all other applicable provisions of this part until it is ex.pended.
(4) Unless otherwise provided in any grant closeout agreement, and subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)
(5) of this section, income received after closeout shall not be governed by the provisions· ofthis part, except that, if
at the time of closeout the recipient has another ongoing CDBG grant received directly from HUD, funds received
after closeout shall be treated as program income of the ongoing grant program.
(5) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income
received after closeout from the disposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall
not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that such income shall be used for activities that meet one of
the national objectives in§ 570.901 and the eligibility requirements described in section 105 of the Act.
(c) Disposition of program income received by subredpients. The written agreement between the recipient and the
subrecipient, as required by§ 570.503, shall specify whether program income received is to be returned to the recipient or

(ii) Agrees to use such program income in accordance with Entitlement program requirements; and
(iii) Has set up Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) access and agrees to enter receipt of

§ 570.606 Displacement, relocation, acquisition, and replacement of housing.
Currentness
(a) General policy for minimizing displacement. Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, grantees (or
States or state recipients, as applicable) shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement
of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of activities assisted under
this part.
(b) Relocation assistance for displaced persons at URA levels.
(1) A displaced person shall be provided with relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with
the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, which contains the government-wide regulations implementing the Uniform
Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655).
(2) Displaced person.
(i) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term "displaced person" means any person (family, individual,
business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property
from real property, permanently and involuntarily, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for
an activity assisted under this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a permanent
move from real property that is made:
(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if applicable) to move permanently from the property,
if the move occurs after the initial official submission to HUD (or the State, as applicable) for grant, loan, or
loan guarantee funds under tbis part that are later provided or granted.
(B) After notice by the property owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs after the
date of the submission of a request for financial assistance by the property owner ( or person in control of the
site) that is later approved for the requested activity.

§ 570.606 Displacement, relocation, acquisition, and ... , 24 C.F.R. § 570.606
(C) Before the date described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee
(or State, as applicable) determines that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or
demolition for the requested activity.
(D) After the "initiation of negotiations" if the person is the tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit and any one
of the following three situations occurs:
(1) The tenant has not been provided with a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable decent,
safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a
monthly rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average utility
costs before the initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income;
or
(2) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the
cost of moving to and from the temporary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions
of the temporary rel ocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the building/complex; or
(3) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the building/complex, but is not offered
reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move.
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the term "displaced person-" does not
include:
(A) A person who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material terms of the lease or
occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this basis, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable)
must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide
relocation assistance under this section;
(B) A person who moves into the property after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or
(B) of this section, but who received a written notice of the expected displacement before occupancy.
(C) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).
(D) A person who the grantee (or State, as applicable) determines is not displaced as a direct result of the
acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must
concur in that determination.
(iii) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) may, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a
person is a displaced person under this section.

§ 570.606 Displacement, relocation, acquisiti on, and ... , 24 C.F.R. § 570.606
(3) Initiation of negotiations. For purposes of detennining the type of replacement housing assistance to be provided
under paragraph (b) of this seclion, if the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation,
demolition, or acquisition of real property, the term "initiation of negotiations" means the execution of the grant or
loan agreement between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling
the real property.
(c) Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan. The grantee shall comply with the requirements of 24
CFR part 42, subpart B.
(d) Optional relocation assistance. Under section 105(a)(I 1) of the Act, the grantee may provide (or the State may permit
the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by
activities that are not subject to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide (or the State may also
permit the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs
(b) or (c) of this section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraphs. Unless such assistance is provided under
State or local law, the grantee (or state recipient, as appl.icable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a
written determination that the assistance is appropriate (see, e.g., 24 CFR 570.20 I (i), as applicable). The grantee (or
state recipient, as applicable) must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance
that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance
within each class of displaced persons.
(e) Acquisition of real property. The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24,
subpart B.
(f) Appeals. If a person disagrees with the determination of the grantee (or the state recipient, as applicable) concerning
the person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment under this section, the person may file a written
appeal of that determination with the grantee ( or state recipient, as applicable). The appeal procedures to be folJowed are
described in 49 CFR 24.10. In addition, a low- or moderate-income household that has been displaced from a dwelling
may file a written request for review of the grantee's decision to the HUD Field Office. For purposes of the State CDBG
program, a low- or moderate-income household may file a written request for review of the state recipient's decision
with the State.
(g) Responsibility of grantee or State.
(1) The grantee (or State, if applicable) is responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this section,
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with the provisions of this section.
For purposes of the State CDBG program, the State shall require state recipients lo certify that they will comply
with the requirements of this section.
(2) The cost of assistance required under this section may be paid from local public funds, funds provided under
this part, or funds available from other sources.
(3) The grantee (or State and state recipient, as applicable) must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this section.

conflict of interest provisions in 2 CFR 200.317 and 200.318, shall apply.
(2) lo all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.317 and 200.318, the provisions of this section shall apply. Such cases

its subrecipients to individuals, businesses, and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such
assistance (e.g., rehabilitation, preservation, and other improvements of private properties or facilities pursuant to
§ 570.202; or grants, loans, and other assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities pursuant to§
570.203, 570.204, 570.455, or 570. 703(i)).
(b) Conflicts prohibited. The general rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or
have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to CDBG activities assisted under this part, or who are in a
position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain
a financial interest or benefit from a CDBG-assisted activity, or have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract,
or agreement with respect to a CDBG-assisted activity, or with respect to the proceeds of the CDBG-assisted activity,
either for themselves or those with whom they have busi11ess or immediate family ties, during their tenure or for one
year thereafter. For the UDAG program, the above restrictions shall apply to all activities that are a part of the UDAG

§ 570.611 Conflict of interest., 24 C.F.R. § 570.611
(1) Threshold requirements. HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following
documentation:
(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of
the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State
or local law.
(2) Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient
has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)(l) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an
exception will serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's
program or project, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program
or project that would otherwise not be available;
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to
be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same
interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;
(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking
process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;
(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph
(b) of this section;
(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public
interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and
(vii) Any other relevant considerations.

§ 570.612 Executive Order 12372.
Currentness
(a) General. Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and the Department's
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 52, allow each State to establish its own process for review and comment on
proposed Federal fin ancial assistance programs.
(b) Applicability. Executive Order 12372 applies to the CDBG Entitlement program and the UDAG program. The
Executive Order applies to all activities proposed to be assisted under UDAG, but it applies to the Entitlement program
only where a grantee proposes to use funds for the planning or construction (reconstruction or installation) of water or
sewer facilities. Such facilities include storm sewers as well as all sanitary sewers, but do not include water and sewer lines
connecting a structure to the lines in the public right-of-way or easement. It is the responsibility of the grantee to initiate
the Executive Order review process if it proposes to use its CDBG or UDAG funds for activities subject to review.

24 C.F.R. § 570.614
§ 570.614 Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Currentness
(a) The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 415 1-4157) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings
and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and
use by, physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or
reallocated under this part after December 11, 1995, and that meets the definition of "residential structure" as defined
in 24 CFR 40.2 or the definition of "building" as defined in 41 CFR 101-l9.602(a) is subject to the requirements of
the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart
101-19.6, for general type buildings).
(b) The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131; 47 U.S.C. 1 55, 201, 218 and 225) (ADA) provides
comprehensive civil rights to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and
local government services, and telecommunications. It further provides that discrimination includes a failure to design
and construct facilities for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by
individuals with disabilities. Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers
that are structural in nature in existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable-that is, easily accomplishable
and able to be carried out without much djfficulty or expense.

§ 200.338 Remedies for noncompliance.
Effective: December 26, 2013
Currentness
If a non-Federal entity fails to comply with Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award,
the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may impose additional conditions, as described in§ 200.207 Specific
conditions. If the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied
by imposing additional conditions, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may take one or more of the
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:
(a) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the non-Federal entity or more severe
enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.
(b) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance.
(c) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the Federal award.
(d) Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and Federal awarding agency
regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a Federal awarding
agency).
(e) Withhold further Federal awards for the project or program.
(t) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
