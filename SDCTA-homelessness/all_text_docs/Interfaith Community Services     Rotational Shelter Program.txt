Use the space below to explain p rofessional services, office equi pment expenditu res or other cost
components that req u i re clarification :
CDBG funded professional services are sub-contracted social service contract to perform intake, screening and
case management for clients. Other (specify) is for client transportation, specifically bus passes and/or gas
vouchers for shelter guests to accomplish aspects of case plans while in the shelter program .
**County-wide, the Rotational Shelter Program leverages approximately $330,000 in volunteer hours and in-kind
donations that are not captured in the budget. Last year, those sources provided $80,798 in meals and in-kind
donations and $245,000 in volunteer hours & services.
Note: CDBG paid expenditures must be documented with receipts and or invoices that verify the expense was
incurred . To minimize the amount of expense documentation, we strongly suggest the CDBG dollars be used to
pay for only a few program costs and not spread out over several line items. If CDBG funds are requested to
pay for Personnel Services (salaries), system-generated reports may be submitted, and copies of timecards,
paychecks, etc. may be retained in Subrecipient's administrative office, and must be made available for review
upon request as set forth in Paragraph 9 of this Agreement.

All l iability insurance required p ursuant to this policy shall provide coverage for a sufficient time
period to protect the City from liability. The insurer is required to provide a minimum of th irty (30)
days-notice of cancellation of any policy. With the approval of the City Attorney (except as
p rovided in s ection 4, h e rein) this obligation may be reduced to not less than ten (1 0) days written
n otice, but o n ly for termination d u e to the non-payment of any premiu m . I n no event shall a policy
be accepted wh ich terminates prior to the completion of the activity to be covered .
I n certain circumstances, it may be impracticable to obtain continuing i nsurance coverage d ue to
the du ration of the activity or the cost of premature renewal. U nder such circumstances , an
exception to the coverage period may be made so long as the policy is renewed or replaced with
an acceptable insurance carrier and there is no lapse in coverage. Maintenance of proper
insurance coverage is a material term of any contract with the City and failure to maintain o r
renew coverage or t o p rovide evidence of renewal may b e treated as a material breach of
contract.
